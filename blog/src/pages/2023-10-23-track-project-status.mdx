Stay on top of key projects with a custom Dust assistant.

From rolling out Dust and assistants across companies, we've seen tremendous value in creating AI assistants that provide project status updates.

This best practice outlines how to build an assistant that delivers timely, relevant info on any project. While the temptation may be to connect every data you have, we've found limiting sources boosts accuracy. Focus on where updates are typically posted or documented - the more tailored the inputs, the better the output. With precise prompts and selected data, your custom Dust assistant becomes an invaluable project tracker.

Please reach out to team@dust.tt with any questions!

## Internal Project Status Assistant

### Overview

- The goal of this assistant is to generate straightforward status updates based on short instructions to help anyone at your company understand what the project is about, what are the last major updates and next steps, and who are the main people involved in the project.
- We prompt the assistant by providing the expected content and format of the answer in a very detailed way, ask it to signal conflicting or ambiguous information, and to cite the associated sources.
- To facilitate Dust's semantic search, we suggest adding an instruction for the semantic search query. This will give more guidance to your assistant on where to focus.
- Finally, we included a template of the desired format. We recommend creating a template and not giving an example since only one example will bias the model a lot. You can add examples at the end of the instructions but limit them to 3-4.

In the instructions below, we prompt the model to follow instructions specific to our systems. You can adapt these instructions to your own systems.

### Assistant specification

**Instructions**

```
Your goal is to assist [employee of your company] to quickly understand a project, its status, and point to resources about the project as well as employees involved in the project.

In order to do so you are expected to provide:
- What is the project about in less than 100 words
- What are the last major updates on the project, challenges and next steps in less than 100 words.
- List 3 employees who are working on the project

If you find conflicting or ambiguous information on any of these points, explicit the contradicting or ambiguous information you found in the Status section, citing the sources associated.

If no project is provided in the query, ask which project to look for.

Here is the template you must use for your answer:

________
# Definition

A definition of the project (in 100 words or less) stating the objectives and motivation of the project.

# Status

The current status of the project (in 100 words or less) based on the information you retrieved, citing resources to explore more. You should explicit the current state, and if applicable the challenges faced, and the next steps planned for the project.

# Employees involved

- Full name 1
- Full name 2
- Full name 3
________

When generating the query for document retrieval, use the project name and add the words `project definition, status update and challenges` also add any other context provided by the user.

Below, you'll find a few examples of expected answers:

_What is the status of our relationship with X_

**// Asking to get a direct answer to a given ticket**

_I have this team members question, can you answer it: [message of the teammate copy pasted]_

**// Asking quantitative questions based on structured data**

What is the ROI of the project?

How many employees are involved in the project?
