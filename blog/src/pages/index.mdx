## Speculative sampling: how LLMs can write a lot faster using other LLMs {{ date: '2023-06-02T00:00Z', id: '2023-06-02-speculative-sampling' }}

Behind the beautiful name of _Speculative sampling_ lies a neat technique to have a large language model can generate tokens **up to three times faster** 🔥 The technique has been developed by various research teams, including one from Google DeepMind [who published it here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01318.pdf).

## A first version of our Product Constitution  {{ date: '2023-05-15T00:00Z', id: '2023-05-15-product-constitution' }}

The opportunity opened by Large Language Models (LLMs) is vast. It’s allowed the birth of Dust, an AI-native company that wants to make work “work better” for smart teams. Deciding on a product constitution to guide what Dust would focus on in the vast space of possible directions was important to us. It will will help us decide locally more effectively. We look forward to continuously improving this first version we’re sharing here.

I've added support for creating per-project `.commitrc` files that override your global settings for that particular project. Went with YAML for these because personally I'm sick of quoting keys in JSON all the time, or accidentally leaving in a trailing comma.
