## Build an AI Assistant to Track Internal Project Status {{ date: '2023-10-23T00:00Z', id: '2023-10-23-track-project-status' }}

Stay on top of key projects with a custom Dust assistant.

From rolling out Dust and assistants across companies, we've seen tremendous value in creating AI assistants that provide project status updates.

This best practice outlines how to build an assistant that delivers timely, relevant info on any project. While the temptation may be to connect every data you have, we've found limiting sources boosts accuracy. Focus on where updates are typically posted or documented - the more tailored the inputs, the better the output. With precise prompts and selected data, your custom Dust assistant becomes an invaluable project tracker.

## Automate SQL Query Generation with a Custom Dust Assistant {{ date: '2023-09-28T00:00Z', id: '2023-09-28-automating-sql-query' }}

Take the load off your data analysts with a Dust assistant specialized in SQL.

From wide-scale rollouts, we've seen immense value in AI assistants that automatically generate SQL queries.

This article outlines building a Dust Custom assistant that outputs analysis-ready SQL. Simply include your most relevant table schemas in the prompt, and direct your assistant to produce queries that plug right into your data tools (Metabase, Snowflake, etc.). Ask it to generate SQL that answers specific questions - no coding needed!

## Speculative sampling: LLMs writing a lot faster using other LLMs {{ date: '2023-06-02T00:00Z', id: '2023-06-02-speculative-sampling' }}

Behind the beautiful name of _Speculative sampling_ lies a neat technique to have a large language model can generate tokens **up to three times faster** üî• The technique has been developed by various research teams, including one from Google DeepMind [who published it here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01318.pdf).

## A first version of our Product Constitution {{ date: '2023-05-15T00:00Z', id: '2023-05-15-product-constitution' }}

The opportunity opened by Large Language Models (LLMs) is vast. It‚Äôs allowed the birth of Dust, an AI-native company that wants to make work ‚Äúwork better‚Äù for smart teams. Deciding on a product constitution to guide what Dust would focus on in the vast space of possible directions was important to us. It will will help us decide locally more effectively. We look forward to continuously improving this first version we‚Äôre sharing here.

## Why work doesn‚Äôt work {{ date: '2023-05-11T00:00Z', id: '2023-05-11-work-doesnt-work' }}

Information overload is a millenia-old challenge that's only been amplified by digital technology. With Large Language Models (LLMs), we can leverage technology to overcome this challenge that every company faces. A new approach is needed: adaptive software that helps teams better harness information flows with software and free up their own time for value-added worked.
