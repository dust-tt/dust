## Project configuration files {{ date: '2023-03-17T00:00Z', id: '2023-03-17-fake-post-2' }}

I've added support for creating per-project `.commitrc` files that override your global settings for that particular project. Went with YAML for these because personally I'm sick of quoting keys in JSON all the time, or accidentally leaving in a trailing comma.

### <SparkleIcon /> Improvements

- Added per-project `.commitrc` configuration files
- Improved performance when working with projects with large binary files
- Fixed a bug that could cause Commit to crash when autocommitting after deleting a recently active branch
