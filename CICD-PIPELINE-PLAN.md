# Dust Platform CI/CD Pipeline Plan

This document outlines the CI/CD pipeline plan for the Dust platform to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this CI/CD pipeline plan is to:

- Automate the build, test, and deployment processes
- Ensure consistent and reliable deployments
- Reduce manual errors and intervention
- Enable rapid iteration and feedback
- Support multiple environments
- Enforce quality gates and security checks
- Provide visibility into the deployment process

### 1.2 Scope

This CI/CD pipeline plan covers:

- Source code management
- Build automation
- Test automation
- Deployment automation
- Environment management
- Security scanning
- Quality gates
- Monitoring and feedback

### 1.3 CI/CD Principles

1. **Automation First**: Automate everything that can be automated
2. **Fail Fast**: Detect and report issues as early as possible
3. **Consistency**: Ensure consistent builds and deployments across environments
4. **Traceability**: Track changes from commit to deployment
5. **Security**: Integrate security checks throughout the pipeline
6. **Quality**: Enforce quality gates at each stage
7. **Visibility**: Provide visibility into the pipeline status and history
8. **Self-Service**: Enable developers to manage their own deployments
9. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and improve the pipeline

## 6. Best Practices

### 6.1 CI/CD Pipeline Best Practices

1. **Keep the pipeline fast**: Optimize build and test steps to run quickly
2. **Make the pipeline reliable**: Ensure consistent results across runs
3. **Make the pipeline transparent**: Provide visibility into pipeline status and history
4. **Make the pipeline secure**: Protect secrets and credentials
5. **Make the pipeline maintainable**: Use modular and reusable components

7. **Make the pipeline scalable**: Support multiple teams and projects
8. **Make the pipeline auditable**: Track changes and approvals

### 6.2 Deployment Best Practices

1. **Use infrastructure as code**: Define infrastructure in code
2. **Use immutable infrastructure**: Create new infrastructure for each deployment
3. **Use blue/green deployments**: Deploy to new environment, switch traffic
4. **Use feature flags**: Control feature availability
5. **Use canary deployments**: Gradually roll out changes
6. **Use automated rollbacks**: Automatically roll back on failure
7. **Use deployment windows**: Deploy during low-traffic periods
8. **Use deployment approvals**: Require approval for production deployments

### 6.3 Security Best Practices

1. **Scan dependencies**: Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
2. **Scan code**: Scan code for security issues
3. **Scan containers**: Scan container images for vulnerabilities
4. **Protect secrets**: Store secrets securely
