            To conditionally render the citations only if a citations React node
            has been passed, you can simply add a conditional check around the
            block that renders the citations. This can be done using a logical
            && operator, which will only render the content on its right side if
            the condition on its left side is true. In this case, the condition
            is the presence of citations.
