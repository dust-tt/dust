description: Rules when writing tests
globs: *.ts,*.tsx,*.js,*.jsx

We use vitest as our testing framework.
Mock external libraries when appropriate.
We have factories and helpers to write tests for front in the front/tests/ folder.
We use the method itInTransaction to wrap each test case in a db transaction and provide total isolation for the test.
