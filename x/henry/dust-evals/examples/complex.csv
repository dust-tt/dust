"Explain the difference between TCP and UDP protocols.","Should mention: TCP is connection-oriented and reliable with guaranteed delivery, UDP is connectionless and faster but without delivery guarantees. Use cases for each should be mentioned."
"What are the main causes of climate change?","Should mention: greenhouse gas emissions (especially CO2), fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, industrial processes, agriculture. Human activities should be identified as primary cause."
