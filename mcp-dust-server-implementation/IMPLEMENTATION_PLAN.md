## Task Management

To manage these tasks, we've created a simple task manager script that you can use to track your progress:

```bash
# List all tasks
npm run tasks list

# Show details of a specific task
npm run tasks show <id>

# Update the status of a task
npm run tasks update <id> <status>

# Show the next task to work on
npm run tasks next
```

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the MCP Dust Server, ensuring that each component is properly implemented and tested before moving on to the next phase.
