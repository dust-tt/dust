# Quickstart

This guide will help you get started with Dust with step-by-step instructions to build your first
Dust app. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can create your first Dust app you need to sign in on
  [Dust](https://dust.tt) with your GitHub account. If needed, you can create
  one [here](https://github.com).
</Note>

## Model providers

Dust apps rely on model providers to interact with large language models. You can setup your first
model provider by clicking on the **Providers** pane and setting up the OpenAI provider (you can
find the **Providers** pane on your main account page by clicking on the Dust logo when signed-in).
You'll need to create an account at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) and retrieve your [API
key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

<Image src="/quickstart_openai_provider.png" alt="OpenAI provider setup">
  _Once you have input a valid API key, you should see the OpenAI provider as
  enabled in the **Providers** panel._
</Image>

Whenever your app interacts with an OpenAI model, it'll use the API key you provided to do so.
The costs of running these models will be reported on OpenAI's dashboard.

## Creating a new app

You can now create a new app by clicking on **New App** from your main dashboard. You'll need to
provide the following information:

<Image src="/quickstart_newapp.png" alt="Dust app creation panel">
  _The Dust app creation panel. The `name` should be short and memorable,
  lowercase without spaces._
</Image>

<Note>
  Public apps are visible to everyone (only you can edit), private apps are
  solely accessible to you, unlisted apps can be viewed by URL (only you can
  edit). Public and unlisted apps can be cloned by others, but cannot be run by
  anyone else than you.
</Note>

Once you click on **Create** you are redirected to your new Dust app's view. The default panel is
the **Specification** panel where you will build your app by adding blocks. The **Datasets** panel
lets you manage datasets (for inputs or few-shot examples).

The **Run** button is disabled at first as you haven't added any block to your app yet.

## First block and first dataset

You are ready to add your first block. Click on **+ Block** and add an `input` block. The
`input` block appears in your app specification view.

<Image
  src="/quickstart_addinput.png"
  alt="First run of the input block"
></Image>

The `input` block needs to get attached to a
dataset. Each time it will be executed, it'll fork your app execution on each element of the dataset
to enable you to design your app against multiple examples to avoid overfitting your design to one
input. You can learn more about how the `input` block works in the [Inputs](/overview#inputs)
section of the platform overview.

Click on **Create Dataset** inside the `input` block to create a new dataset. You are now redirected
to the **Datasets** panel. And a new draft dataset with GAFAM companies data has been prepared
but we won't use it for the `input` block.

Give the name you want to your dataset, you can leave the description empty. The **Schema** lets you control the schema
of your dataset's entries. The Data section lets you edit, add, or remove elements to your dataset.

**Change the schema** to use `currentCompany` with a type of `string` and `currentCity` with a type of `string` as well.
We will ask our user to provider their current company and city to generate find them a new place to work.

Fill a few entries in the "Data" sections, these are the _example entries_ that will be used for testing during the app design.

<Image src="/quickstart_dataset.png" alt="First run of the input block">
  _This is the expected state of your dataset for this example_
</Image>

You can now return to your app's specification view and select the dataset you created from the `input`
block dropdown.

<Note>
  The `input` block is a special block that is used to provide the initial input
  to your app. You can think of it as the entry point to your app, so when
  building your app the actual data in your dataset (not the schema, but the
  data) are _mainly used to test your app_. You can edit them between runs by
  clicking the "Edit" button next to the dataset name. The `input` block will
  use your schema's descriptions to infer the right data when the app is run
  from an assistant, or use the provided data when run from the API.
</Note>

It is time to run your app for the first time! Click **Run** and wait for the execution to complete.

<Image src="/quickstart_input.png" alt="First run of the input block">
  _This is the expected state of your Dust app. The `input` block was run and
  triggered 3 parallel executions of your app because we had 3 data points in
  our dataset. For each execution you can see the output of the `input` block
  which corresponds to each element of the dataset it is associated with. The
  examples in your dataset might differ from the ones shown above._
</Image>

## Data blocks

Before we can add our first `chat` block, we'll add a `data` block to the app to store the few-shot
examples used to prompt the model. Go to the **Datasets** panel and create a new dataset.

Name it _examples_ and save it directly, as the default data in it correspond to what we are trying to add (a list of company names, location and employees count).
You can add more examples to the dataset if you want to test your app with more examples or [download this file containing 20 examples](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19n3-7sHLg1O6HlZF69G2M6qnoJZN2DQA/view?usp=sharing) and use the `Import JSONL` button at the bottom of the page to import it.

Return to the **Specification** panel and click the **+ Block** button and add a `data` block.

Similarly to the `input` block, the data block must be attached to a dataset. Click on the `data`
block **Select Dataset** button and select _examples_.

<Note>
  Note that your blocks are automatically given a default name (_EXAMPLES_ for
  your `data` block). You can change the name of your blocks by clicking on the
  block name in the specification view. Let's keep the default name for now so
  that we can refer to it in the next blocks.
</Note>

Run your app again! You should be able to see the outputs of both the `input` block and the newly
created `data` block.

<Image src="/quickstart_data.png" alt="Execution of the data block">
  _This is the expected state of your Dust app. As you can see the `data` block
  has a different behaviour than the `input` block. For each execution stream it
  returns the entire dataset as an array. This dataset is the same for each
  execution stream and will be use to few-shot prompt the model in the next
  block. The examples in your datasets might differ from the ones shown above._
</Image>

## Chat (LLM) blocks

We're ready to interact with a Large Language Model. Add a `chat` block, select _openai_ as provider
and _gpt-4o_ as model. You can leave the `temperature`, `max_tokens` and `stop` unchanged.

Now it's time to construct our prompt. The prompt field supports [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs)
templating to construct the prompt to the model from the outputs of the previously executed blocks.
You can refer to the [LLM Block](core-blocks#llm-block) documentation for more details on the
templating system.

We will use the following prompt in the _instructions_ text area to encode in the model (using few-shot prompting) the task of answering the question provided in the `input` block:

**Instructions**

```
{% for e in EXAMPLES %}
COMPANY NAME: {{e.companyName}}
LOCATION: {{e.headquarters}}
EMPLOYEES COUNT: {{e.employees}}
{% endfor %}
```

**Message**

```
_fun = (env) => {
  return [{ role: "user", content: `My current city is ${env.state.INPUT.currentCity} \
  and my current company is ${env.state.INPUT.currentCompany} \
  Using the examples provided which company should I work for? \
  Make sure it is not my current company, that the headquarters are in my continent \
  and be aware that I prefer smaller companies.`}];
}
```

As the `chat` block will be executed, it will receive as prompt the result of executing the template
above, which should consists in:

```
COMPANY NAME: AstraZeneca
LOCATION: 70000
EMPLOYEES COUNT: Vevey, Switzerland

COMPANY NAME: Toyota
LOCATION: 359542
EMPLOYEES COUNT: Toyota City, Japan

[]...]
```

This is called few-shot prompting, by showing a few valid examples, we encode the task in the model.
We finish the prompt with just the question from the input we're working on. As the model will try
to answer the prompt, it should naturally try to answer the question with a valid answer.

You can now run your app. It will be a bit slower this time as we'll have to wait for the model to
generate an answer by calling into the OpenAI API.

<Note>
  If you run the unmodified app again, the automatic caching mechanism of the
  `chat` block will kick in and you won't spend any resources on OpenAI.
</Note>

You can explore the outputs of the `chat` block. It contains a `message` object containing the `role` and `content` keys. The `content` key contains the model's answer.
You can check that the values returned by the model are indeed correct.

<Image src="/quickstart_chat.png" alt="Execution of the chat block">
  _This is the expected configuration and state of the `chat` block after your
  final execution of your app. Since there are 3 example data inputs in our
  `input` block dataset, there are 3 parallel executions of the app and
  therefore 3 outputs returned by the `chat` block._
</Image>

## Final code block

We can finally add a `code` block to extract the answers from the model's completion. Name the
`code` block _FINAL_. Code blocks' code parameter must define a Javascript `_fun` function accepting
an `env` variable. The `env` variable enables you to access the output of the previous blocks. We'll
use the following code:

```js
_fun = (env) => {
  return {
    currentJob: [env.state.INPUT.currentCompany, env.state.INPUT.currentCity],
    nextJobAnswer: env.state.MODEL.message.content.trim(),
  };
};
```

We're simply echoing the input `currentCompany` and `currentCity` and returning the answer generated by the model by triming
its message content. You can now run your app and explore the 3 executions' final outputs to check that
all answers are correct.

<Image src="/quickstart_final.png" alt="Execution of the llm block">
  _This is the expected output of the final block, echoing the intput question
  and the generated answer. The question may be different in your app._

Congrats on designing your first Dust app! You can inspect the different runs on your app in the
**Logs** panel and see the various iterations we went through as we built the app.

## (Advanced) Running your app by API

Congrats on designing your first app! You can now return to your profile by clicking the Dust logo
to create a new API key in the **API Keys** panel. Click **Create new API Key**, name it and
return to the **Apps** panel and finally to your app.

<Image src="/quickstart_apikey.png" alt="Execution of the chat block">
  _API keys stay visible 10 minutes after creation. After that, you won't be
  able to see them again. And in case you want to try, the visible API Key on
  the screenshot is fake ;)_
</Image>

Now return to the **Specification** panel in your app and click the **View API endpoint** button. Simply click the **Copy**
button and copy the curl command in your favourite editor. You can leave the cURL command untouched and the `inputs` field in the body that your app expects:

`"inputs": [{ "currentCompany": "La Poste", "currentCity": "Paris; France"}]`

<Note>
  As you copy the curl command from the **Deploy** modal, your newly created API
  key is automatically inserted as `Authentication` header. 10 minutes after
  creation, the API key will be hidden and you will have to manually replace it
  so save it somewhere!
</Note>

You can now prefix your file with `#!/bin/sh` and save it as a `.sh` and execute it from your
terminal.

Congrats, you've executed your app by API call.
You can check the execution in the **Logs** panel under the **API** section.
