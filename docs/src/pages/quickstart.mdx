# Quickstart

This guide will help you get started with Dust with step-by-step instructions to build your first
Dust app. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can create your first Dust app you need to sign in on
  [Dust](https://dust.tt) with your GitHub account. If needed, you can create
  one [here](https://github.com).
</Note>

## Setting up your first model provider

Dust apps rely on model providers to interact with large language models. You can setup your first
model provider by clicking on the **Providers** pane and setting up the OpenAI provider (you can
find the **Providers** pane on your main account page by clicking on the Dust logo when signed-in).
You'll need to create an account at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) and retrieve your [API
key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

<Image src="/quickstart_openai_provider.png" alt="OpenAI provider setup">
  _Once you have input a valid API key, you should see the OpenAI provider as
  enabled in the **Providers** panel._
</Image>

Whenever your app interacts with an OpenAI model, it'll use the API key you provided to do so.
The costs of running these models will be reported on OpenAI's dashboard.

## Creating a new app

You can now create a new app by clicking on **New App** from your main dashboard. You'll need to
provide the following information:

<Image src="/quickstart_newapp.png" alt="Dust app creation panel">
  _The Dust app creation panel. The `name` should be short and memorable,
  lowercase without spaces._
</Image>

<Note>
  Public apps are visible to everyone (only you can edit), private apps are
  solely accessible to you, unlisted apps can be viewed by URL (only you can
  edit). Public and unlisted apps can be cloned by others, but cannot be run by
  anyone else than you.
</Note>

Once you click on **Create** you are redirected to your new Dust app's view. The default panel is
the **Specification** panel where you will build your app by adding blocks. The **Datasets** panel
lets you manage datasets (for inputs or few-shot examples).

The **Run** button is disabled at first as you haven't added any block to your app yet.

## Add your first block

You are ready to add your first block. Click on **+ Block** and add an `input` block. The
`input` block appears in your app specification view. The `input` block needs to get attached to a
dataset. Each time it will be executed, it'll fork your app execution on each element of the dataset
to enable you to design your app against multiple examples to avoid overfitting your design to one
input. You can learn more about how the `input` block works in the [Inputs](/overview#inputs)
section of the platform overview.

Click on **Create Dataset** inside the `input` block to create a new dataset. You are now redirected
to the **Datasets** panel. And a new draft dataset with basic arithmetic questions has been prepared
for you. Give the name _dev_ to your dataset, you can leave the description empty. Our example app
will attempt to answer these basic arithmetic questions. The **Schema** lets you control the schema
of your dataset's entries. The Data section lets you edit, add, or remove elements to your dataset.
You can leave the dataset as-is and click **Create**.

You can now return to your app's specification view and select the _dev_ dataset from the `input`
block dropdown.

It is time to run your app for the first time! Click **Run** and wait for the execution to complete.

<Image src="/quickstart_input.png" alt="First run of the input block">
  _This is the expected state of your Dust app. The `input` block was run and
  triggered 3 parallel executions of your app. For each execution you can see
  the output of the `input` block which corresponds to each element of the
  dataset it is associated with. The examples in your dataset might differ from
  the ones shown above._
</Image>

## Data blocks

Before we can add our first `llm` block, we'll add a `data` block to the app to store the few-shot
examples used to prompt the model. Go to the **Datasets** panel and create a new dataset. Name it
_examples_ and save it directly.

Return to the **Specification** panel and click the **+ Block** button and add a `data` block.
Similarly to the `input` block, the data block must be attached to a dataset. Click on the `data`
block **Select Dataset** button and select _examples_.

<Note>
  Note that your blocks are automatically given a default name (_EXAMPLES_ for
  your `data` block). You can change the name of your blocks by clicking on the
  block name in the specification view. Let's keep the default name for now so
  that we can refer to it in the next blocks.
</Note>

Run your app again! You should be able to see the outputs of both the `input` block and the newly
created `data` block.

<Image src="/quickstart_data.png" alt="Execution of the data block">
  _This is the expected state of your Dust app. As you can see the `data` block
  has a different behaviour than the `input` block. For each execution stream it
  returns the entire dataset as an array. This dataset is the same for each
  execution stream and will be use to few-shot prompt the model in the next
  block. The examples in your datasets might differ from the ones shown above._
</Image>

## LLM blocks

We're ready to interact with a large language model. Add an `llm` block, select _openai_ as provider
and _text-davinci-003_ as model. You can leave the `temperature` and `max_tokens` unchanged.

Now it's time to construct our prompt. The prompt field supports [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs)
templating to construct the prompt to the model from the outputs of the previously executed blocks.
You can refer to the [LLM Block](core-blocks#llm-block) documentation for more details on the
templating system.

We will use the following prompt to encode in the model (using few-shot prompting) that we want it
to reply with a valid numerical answer:

```
{% for e in EXAMPLES %}
QUESTION: {{e.question}}
ANSWER: {{e.answer}}
{% endfor %}
QUESTION: {{INPUT.question}}
ANSWER:
```

As the `llm` block will be executed, it will receive as prompt the result of executing the template
above, which should consists in:

```
QUESTION: What is 2+2?
ANSWER: 4

QUESTION: What is 5^2?
ANSWER: 25

QUESTION: What is 23*9?
ANSWER: 207

QUESTION: What is 12*4?
ANSWER:
```

This is called few-shot prompting, by showing a few valid examples, we encode the task in the model.
We finish the prompt with just the question from the input we're working on. As the model will try
to complete the prompt, it should naturally try to answer the question with a valid answer.

Also add a `stop` sequence, by typing in _QUESTION_ and hitting enter. This will stop the generation
from the model once it encounters the _QUESTION_ sequence. This may happen as the model may simply
tries to complete the prompt with more questions and answers after genereting the answer to your
question.

You can now run your app. It will be a bit slower this time as we'll have to wait for the model to
generate an answer by calling into the OpenAI API.

<Note>
  If you run the unmodified app again, the automatic caching mechanism of the
  `llm` block will kick in and you won't spend any resources on OpenAI.
</Note>

You can explore the outputs of the `llm` block. It contains both a `prompt` object representing
what was sent to the model and a `completion` object which is the completion generated by the model.
You can check that the values returned by the model are indeed correct.

<Image src="/quickstart_llm.png" alt="Execution of the llm block">
  _This is the expected configuration and state of the `llm` block after your
  final execution of your app. Since there are 3 inputs in our `input` block
  dataset, there are 3 parallel executions of the app and therefore 3 outputs
  returned by the `llm` block._
</Image>

## Final code block

We can finally add a `code` block to extract the answers from the model's completion. Name the
`code` block _FINAL_. Code blocks' code parameter must define a Javascript `_fun` function accepting
an `env` variable. The `env` variable enables you to access the output of the previous blocks. We'll
use the following code:

```js
_fun = (env) => {
  return {
    question: env.state.INPUT.question,
    answer: env.state.MODEL.completion.text.trim(),
  };
};
```

We're simply echoing the input `question` and returning the answer generated by the model by triming
its completion. You can now run your app and explore the 3 executions' final outputs to check that
all answers are correct.

<Image src="/quickstart_final.png" alt="Execution of the llm block">
  _This is the expected output of the final block, echoing the intput question
  and the generated answer. The question may be different in your app._

Congrats on designing your first Dust app! You can inspect the different runs on your app in the
**Runs** panel and see the various iterations we went through as we built the app.

## (Advanced) Running your app by API

Congrats on designing your first app! You can now return to your profile by clicking the Dust logo
to create a new API key in the **API Keys** panel. Click **Create new secret key** and
return to the **Apps** panel and finally to your app.

As you can see the full state of the app is preserved, including block outputs.

Now return to the **Specification** panel and click the **Deploy** button. Simply click the **Copy**
button and copy the curl command in your favourite editor. You can leave the curl command untouched
exception for the input given that your app expects an object with a `question` field. Modify the
object and add an arithmetic question of your choice.

<Note>
  As you copy the curl command from the **Deploy** modal, your newly created API
  key is automatically inserted as `Authentication` header.
</Note>

You can now prefix your file with `#!/bin/sh` and save it as a `.sh` and execute it from your
terminal.

Congrats, you've executed your app by API. You can check the execution in the **Runs** panel under
the **API** section.
