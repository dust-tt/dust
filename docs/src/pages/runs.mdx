# Runs

On this page we'll dive into the Runs endpoint you can use to execute Dust apps programmatically.
We'll look at how to query, create, update, and delete runs. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Authentication

All requests to the Dust API must be authenticated using an `Authentication` header. The value of
this header must be the string _Bearer_ followed by a space and your API key. You can find your API
key in your account's **Developers Tools** panel.

## The Run model

The Run model contains all the information about the execution of a Dust app.

### Properties

<Properties>
  <Property name="run_id" type="string">
    Unique identifier for the run.
  </Property>
  <Property name="created" type="integer">
    Unix epoch in ms marking the creation of the run.
  </Property>
  <Property name="run_type" type="string">
    One of `local` (run created from the Dust interface during design phase) or
    `deployed` (run created by API).
  </Property>
  <Property name="config" type="object">
    An object representing the configuration of the run (see the
    [Block](/overview#blocks) documentation for details on the difference
    between block specification and configuration). Keys are block names and
    values are objects containing the configuration used for the associated
    block as part of this run.
  </Property>
  <Property name="status" type="object">
    An object representing the status of the run. It contains a field `run`
    showing the global status of the run (one of _running_, _errored_ or
    _succeeded_) and a `blocks` field which is an array providing detailed
    status for each block of the app. Each block status object exposes
    `block_type`, `name`, `status` (one of _running_, _errored_ or _succeeded_),
    `success_count` and `error_count`. If the status of the block is not
    _running_ then the sum of `success_count` and `error_count` will be equal to
    the number of times the block has been executed (number of inputs and
    posssibly more if part of a `map` `reduce` pair).
  </Property>
  <Property
    name="traces"
    type="[]((block_type, block_name), [][]block_execution)"
  >
    An array tracing the execution of each block. Each element of the top-level
    array is an array whose first element is a tuple with the block type and
    block name. The second element is an array of arrays of block executions.
    The first dimension is the input dimension (one element per input passed as
    argument to the run) the second dimension is the map dimension (only one
    element if outside of a `map` `reduce` block, otherwise one element per
    iteration of the `map` block). The block execution is an object with fields
    `value` and `error`. At most one is set. If `value` is set, it contains the
    output of the block execution. If `error` is set, it contains the error
    returned by the block.
  </Property>
  <Property name="specification_hash" type="string">
    The hash of the specification used to create the run.
  </Property>
  <Property name="results" type="[][]block_execution">
    Only set if the run status is _succeeded_. The block executions of the last
    block of the app (see above for the structure of the array of array of block
    executions).
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Create a Run {{ tag: 'POST', label: '/v1/w/:workspace_id/apps/:app_id/runs' }}

<Row>
  <Col>

    This endpoint allows you to execute a Dust app by API by creating a new Run object. To get a
    prefilled and ready-to-use curl command, click **Deploy** from your app
    specification view. You can only run your own apps. If you want to run someone else's app,
    simply clone it and run the cloned version from your account.

    ### URL attributes

    <Properties>
      <Property name="workspace_id" type="string">
        The ID of the app's workspace (can be found in the app's URL)
      </Property>
      <Property name="app_id" type="string">
        The ID of the Dust app you want to execute.
      </Property>
    </Properties>

    ### JSON body attributes

    Attributes are passed as a JSON object in the request body.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="specification_hash" type="string">
        The hash of the specification to use. If you change your app specifiction, make sure to
        update the hash. This guarantees that you won't break an existing API integration by
        iterating on your app design.
      </Property>
      <Property name="config" type="object">
        The configuration of the app to use. See the [Block](/overview#blocks) documentation for
        more details on the difference between block specification and configuration. Keys are block
        names and values are objects containing the configuration used for the associated block as
        part of this run. Each block documentation also contains a list of configurable values.
      </Property>
      <Property name="inputs" type="[]object">
        An array of inputs to run your app with, represented as JSON objects.
      </Property>
    </Properties>

    ### Optional JSON body attributes

    <Properties>
      <Property name="stream" type="bool">
        Whether to stream the run as Server-Sent Events (SSE). If `use_stream` is set in the model
        config, this will also stream the tokens as they get emitted by the model (if supported by
        the provider). If set to _true_ the `blocking` parameter is ignored.
      </Property>
      <Property name="blocking" type="bool">
        Whether to block the API call until the app has finished running. If set to _false_
        (default), the API call will return directly with the initial status of the Run. You can
        then poll the Run using the `GET` request below.
