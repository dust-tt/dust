# Data Sources

An overview of Dust's Data Sources. You'll learn how to create Data Sources, upload documents and
leverage them to build more context-aware apps. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Dust's Data Sources provide a fully managed semantic search solution. A Data Source is a managed
store of documents on which semantic searches can be performed. Documents can be ingested by API or
uploaded manually from the Dust interface.

Once uploaded, documents are automatically chunked, embedded and indexed. Searches can be performed
against the documents of a Data Source using the [`data_source`](core-blocks#data-source-block)
block which, given a query, automatically embeds it and performs a vector search operation to
retrieve the most semantically relevant documents and associated chunks.

<Note>
  Semantic search, generally based on [embedding
  models](/introduction#embedding-models), is important to large language model
  apps because of the limited context size of models. It enables the retrieval
  of chunks of valuable information that fit in context to perform a particular
  task. This is called _retrieval-augmented generation_.
</Note>

Data sources enable apps to perform semantic searches over large collections of documents, only
retrieving the chunks of information that are the most relevant to the app's task, without having to
manage the complexity of setting up vector search database, chunking docouments and embedding chunks
and finally performing vector search queries.

## Data Source creation

Creating a Data Source simply consists in providing a name and a description.

### Parameters

<Properties>
  <Property name="name" type="string">
    The name of the new Data Source. It should be short and can only contain
    lowercase alphanumerical characters as well as `-`.
  </Property>
  <Property name="description" type="optional string">
    A description of the content of the Data Source.
  </Property>
  <Property name="visibility" type="string">
    One of _public_ or _private_. Only you can edit your own Data Sources. If
    _public_ other users can view the Data Source and query from it.
  </Property>
</Properties>

Data sources are created empty. Their description can be edited from the Settings panel. They cannot
be renamed but they can be deleted from the same panel.

## Document insertion

Once a Data Source is created, documents can be inserted from the Dust interface or by API. When
a document is inserted, the following happens automatically:

- **Chunking**: The document is pre-processed to remove repeated whitespaces (helps semantic search)
  and chunked using `max_chunk_size` tokens per chunks.
- **Embedding**: Each chunk is embedded (in parallel, with retries) using the embedding model
  parametered on the Data Source.
- **Indexing**: Each resulting embedding vector is inserted in a vector search database along with
  metadata about the document and the original chunk text.

The following parameters are accepted when inserting a document:

### Parameters

<Properties>
  <Property name="document_id" type="string">
    A unique ID for the document. The semantics of the insertion really is an
    upsertion. Inserting with a `document_id` that does not exist will create
    that document, it will otherwise replace the previous document version
    (removing previous chunks from the vector search db and replacing by the
    updated document's).
  </Property>
  <Property name="text" type="string">
    The text content of the document.
  </Property>
  <Property name="timestamp" type="optional integer">
    User specified timestamp (epoch in ms) for the document. Can be used to
    filter documents when querying the Data Source based on their timestamp. If
    not specified, defaults to the time at insertion.
  </Property>
  <Property name="tags" type="optional []string">
    User specified list of string tags. Can be used to filter the results by
    tags when querying the Data Source. See the
    [`data_source`](core-blocks#data-source-block) block for more details. If
    not specified, defaults to the empty list.
  </Property>
  <Property name="source_url" type="optional string">
    User specified source URL for the document.
  </Property>
</Properties>

See the [Documents](/documents) API reference to learn how to insert documents by API. Data
sources need to be created from the Dust interface.

### Uploading directories of files to your Data Source

We also have a script you can use to upload a directory's contents to your data source. Copy the following code into `upload.py` and then fill in the values for your Dust API key, the workspace id you are in, and the data source you want to upload to. Then run `python <dir>`, where `dir` is the directory from which you want to upload the documents.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import requests
import pathlib
import pdftotext
import sys

# The three following variables need to be set with your own Dust API key (can be found in the interface),
# Workspace ID (can be found in the workspace URL) and Data Source ID:
DUST_API_KEY=""
DUST_WORKSPACE_ID=""
DUST_DATA_SOURCE_ID=""
ENDPOINT= f"https://dust.tt/api/v1/w/{DUST_WORKSPACE_ID}/data_sources/{DUST_DATA_SOURCE_ID}/documents/"

def upload(text, file):
    url = ENDPOINT + file.stem
    r = requests.post(url, headers={'Authorization': "Bearer " + DUST_API_KEY}, json={
        "text": text,
    })
    return r

directory = sys.argv[1]

# iterate through all files and upload text or pdf2text
for file in pathlib.Path(directory).rglob("*"):
    if file.is_file():
        if file.suffix == ".pdf":
            resp = upload("\n\n".join(pdftotext.PDF(file.open("rb"))) , file)
        elif file.suffix in [".txt", ".md"]:
            resp = upload(file.read_text(), file)
        else: continue
        if resp.status_code == 200:
            print("Uploaded", file)
        else:
            print("Error uploading", file)
            print(resp.text)
```

Example usage, once values are filled in: `python upload.py test_dir/`.

## Document deletion

When deleting a document, all associated chunks are automatically removed from the vector search
database of the Data Source. Documents can be deleted from the Dust interface or by API.

<Note>
  Data sources can be deleted from the Dust interface. When deleted, all
  associated data (all documents and associaed chunks) are deleted from our
  systems.
</Note>

See the [Documents](/documents) API reference to learn how to delete documents by API.

## Querying a Data Source

Querying a Data Source is done using the [`data_source`](core-blocks#data-source-block) block. The
`data_source` block returns a list of [Document](/documents#the-document-model) objects. Each
document may include one or more [Chunks](/documents#the-chunk-model) (the chunks returned by
the semantic search are aggregated per document).

When a query is run the following happens automatically:

- **Embedding**: The query is embedded using the embedding model set on the Data Source.
- **Search**: A vector search query is run against the embedding vectors of the Data Source's
  documents' chunks.
- **Union**: Most relevant chunks' documents are retrieved and chunks are associated to their
  original document object.
