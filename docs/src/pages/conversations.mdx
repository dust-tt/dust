# Conversations

On this page we'll dive into the Conversations endpoints you can use to programmatically start
conversations and post messages to interact with Dust assistants. We'll look into how to create a
converstaion, post a message, retrieve a conversation and stream events about it. {{ className:
'lead' }}

## Authentication

All requests to the Dust API must be authenticated using an `Authentication` header. The value of
this header must be the string _Bearer_ followed by a space and your API key. You can find your API
key in your account's **Developers Tools** panel.

## Conversations

A conversation is consituted of `UserMessages`, `AgentMessages` and `ContentFragments`.

A `UserMessage` is a message sent by a human to interact with one or more assistants.

An `AgentMessage` is an assistant response. `AgentMessages` can potentially include an action.
Currently the only action supported are:

- `RetrievalAction` which triggers for agents configured to perform a retrieval before streaming their response.
- `DustAppRunAction` which triggers for agents configured to run a Dust App before streaming their response.

`ContentFragments` are pieces of information that can be inserted in conversations and are passed to
assistants as part of the context.

## The UserMessage model

The `UserMessage` model contains all the information and data related to a user message.

### Properties

<Properties>
  <Property name="sId" type="string">
    Unique identifier for the message.
  </Property>
  <Property name="visibility" type="string">

    message was created through the Dust interface by a logged in user.
  </Property>
  <Property name="mentions" type="[]object">

    single `configurationId` field which points the assistant being mentioned.
  </Property>
  <Property name="content" type="string">
    The content of the message. In this content, mentions to assistants are
    rendered as markdown directives `:cite[assistantName]{configurationId}`.
  </Property>
  <Property name="context" type="object">
    Context about the user who sent the message. This will be based on the user
    profile if the message was created by a logged in user, or on the `context`
    provided when the message was created by API.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## The AgentMessage model

The `AgentMessage` model contains all the information and data related to an agent message.

    `created` status until the assistant has finished processing it.
  </Property>

## Conversation events

A conversation will emit the following events that can be streamed by API (see below):

The `user_message_new` event is sent when a new UserMessage is received.

```
{
  type: "user_message_new";
  created: number;
  messageId: string;
  message: UserMessage;
}
```

The `agent_message_new` event is sent when a new AgentMessage is received. The agent message status
will initially be `created`.

```
{
  type: "agent_message_new";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  message: AgentMessage;
}
```

The `conversation_title` event is sent when the title of the conversation is updated (manually or
automatically after the first user assistant interaction).

```
{
  type: "conversation_title";
  created: number;
  title: string;
}
```

## AgentMessage events

AgentMessages have a complex lifecycle going from possibly running an action, to streaming tokens
and finally being marked as `succeeded`. These events can be streamed by API (see below).

### Action events

#### Retrieval Action events

The `retrieval_params` event is sent during retrieval (if applicable) with the finalized query used
to retrieve documents.

```
{
  type: "retrieval_params";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  dataSources: "all" | DataSourceConfiguration[];
  action: RetrievalActionType;
}
```

#### DustAppRun Action events

The `dust_app_run_params` event is sent during the preparation of the execution of the Dust app (if
applicable) with the finalized inputs for the app infered by a model from the conversation context
and the Dust app's input dataset schema.

```
{
  type: "dust_app_run_params";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  action: DustAppRunActionType;
}
```

The `dust_app_run_block` event is sent during the execution of the Dust app as a block execution
starts. The field `runningBlock` will be non-null on the action object.

```
{
  type: "dust_app_run_block";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  action: DustAppRunActionType;
}
```

#### Generic Action events

The `agent_action_success` event is sent once the assistant action is completed (if applicable), as
we're moving to generating a message if applicable. The currently supported actions are `retrieval`
and `dust_app_run`. If the assistant is configured to not perform any action, these events won't be
emitted.

```
{
  type: "agent_action_success";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  action: AgentActionType;
}
```

### Generation events

The `generation_tokens` event is sent when tokens are streamed as the the assistant is generating a message.

```
{
  type: "generation_tokens";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  text: string;
}
```

### Other events

The `agent_message_success` event is sent once the message is fully completed and successful.

```
{
  type: "agent_message_success";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  message: AgentMessageType;
}
```

The `agent_error` event is sent whenever an error occured durint the AgentMessage lifecycle.

```
{
  type: "agent_error";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
  };
}
```

## Create a Conversation {{ tag: 'POST', label: '/v1/w/:workspace_id/assistant/conversations' }}

<Row>
  <Col>
    This endpoint allows you to create a Conversation potentially posting an initial user message at
    the same time. If you specify an initial user message, the conversation objet returned will be
    returned including the user message and potential assistant response messages as they got added
    (`created` status). Knowing their `sId` will enable you to stream their events without having to
    retrieve the conversation object again.

    This endpoint allows you to stream a Conversation's event (see event definitions above). Events
    are streamed using Server Side Rendering and wrapped in the structure:

      "data": ${EVENT_DATA}
    }

    Note that events can be repeated across API calls.
