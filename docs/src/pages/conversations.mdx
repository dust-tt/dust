# Conversations

On this page we'll dive into the Conversations endpoints you can use to programatically start
conversations and post messages to interact with Dust assistants. We'll look into how to create a
converstaion, post a message, retrieve a conversation and stream events about it. {{ className:
'lead' }}

## Authentication

All requests to the Dust API must be authenticated using an `Authentication` header. The value of
this header must be the string _Bearer_ followed by a space and your API key. You can find your API
key in your account's **Developers Tools** panel.

## Conversations

A conversation is consituted of `UserMessage` and `AgentMessages`. A `UserMessage` is a message sent
by a human to interact with one or more assistants. An `AgentMessage` is an assistant response.
`AgentMessages` can potentially include an action. Currently the only action supported is a
`RetrievalAction` which triggers for agents that are configured to perform a retrieval before
streaming their response.

## The UserMessage model

The `UserMessage` model contains all the information and data related to a user message.

### Properties

<Properties>
  <Property name="sId" type="string">
    Unique identifier for the message.
  </Property>
  <Property name="visibility" type="string">
    One of `visible` or `deleted`.
  </Property>
  <Property name="version" type="integer">
    The version number of the message.
  </Property>
  <Property name="user" type="object | null">
    Information about the user that created that message. Only set if the
    message was created through the Dust interface by a logged in user.
  </Property>
  <Property name="mentions" type="[]object">
    A list of `AgentMentions` objects. An `AgentMention` is an object with a
    single `configurationId` field which points the assistant being mentioned.
  </Property>
  <Property name="content" type="string">
    The content of the message. In this content, mentions to assistants are
    rendered as markdown directives `:cite[assistantName]{configurationId}`.
  </Property>
  <Property name="context" type="object">
    Context about the user who sent the message. This will be based on the user
    profile if the message was created by a logged in user, or on the `context`
    provided when the message was created by API.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## The AgentMessage model

The `AgentMessage` model contains all the information and data related to an agent message.

### Properties

<Properties>
  <Property name="sId" type="string">
    Unique identifier for the message.
  </Property>
  <Property name="visibility" type="string">
    One of `visible` or `deleted`.
  </Property>
  <Property name="version" type="integer">
    The version number of the message.
  </Property>
  <Property name="parentMessageId" type="string">
    The unique identifier of the `UserMessage` this `AgentMessage` is a response
    to.
  </Property>
  <Property name="configurtion" type="object">
    The configuration of the assistant that generated this message.
  </Property>
  <Property name="status" type="string">
    One of `created`, `succeeded` or `failed`. A message will remain in
    `created` status until the assistant has finished processing it.
  </Property>
  <Property name="action" type="object | null">
    An object representing the potential action that the assistant took before
    generating an answer. Currently only `RetrievalAction` are supported.
  </Property>
  <Property name="content" type="string">
    The content of the message.
  </Property>
  <Property name="error" type="object | null">
    If an error occured this object will be set with a `code` and a `message`.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## The Conversation model

The Conversation model contains all the information and data related to a conversation.

### Properties

<Properties>
  <Property name="sId" type="string">
    Unique identifier for the conversation.
  </Property>
  <Property name="created" type="integer">
    Epoch of the creation of the conversation.
  </Property>
  <Property name="owner" type="object">
    Information about the workspace owning this conversation.
  </Property>
  <Property name="title" type="string | null">
    The title of the conversation if set.
  </Property>
  <Property name="visibility" type="string">
    One of `deleted` or `unlisted`.
  </Property>
  <Property name="content" type="(UserMessage[] | AgentMessage[])[]">
    A list (the converation) of either `UserMessage` or `AgentMessage` lists
    (the versions for each message of the conversations).
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Conversation events

A conversation will emit the following events that can be streamed by API (see below):

The `user_message_new` event is sent when a new UserMessage is received.

```
{
  type: "user_message_new";
  created: number;
  messageId: string;
  message: UserMessage;
}
```

The `agent_message_new` event is sent when a new AgentMessage is received. The agent message status
will initially be `created`.

```
{
  type: "agent_message_new";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  message: AgentMessage;
}
```

The `conversation_title` event is sent when the title of the conversation is updated (manually or
automatically after the first user assistant interaction).

```
{
  type: "conversation_title";
  created: number;
  title: string;
}
```

## AgentMessage events

AgentMessages have a complex lifecycle going from possibly running an action, to streaming tokens
and finally being marked as `succeeded`. These events can be streamed by API (see below).

### Action events

The `retrieval_params` is sent during retrieval (if applicable) with the finalized query used to
retrieve documents.

```
{
  type: "retrieval_params";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  dataSources: "all" | DataSourceConfiguration[];
  action: RetrievalActionType;
}
```

The `agent_action_success` event is sent once the assistant action is completed (if applicable), as
we're moving to generating a message if applicable. The currently supported action is `retrieval`.
If the assistant is configured to not perform any retrieval, these events won't be emitted.

```
{
  type: "agent_action_success";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  action: AgentActionType;
}
```

### Generation events

The `generation_tokens` event is sent when tokens are streamed as the the assistant is generating a message.

```
{
  type: "generation_tokens";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  text: string;
}
```

The `agent_generation_success` event is sent once the generation has completed.

```
{
  type: "agent_generation_success";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  text: string;
}
```

### Other events

The `agent_message_success` event is sent once the message is fully completed and successful.

```
{
  type: "agent_message_success";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  message: AgentMessageType;
}
```

The `agent_error` event is sent whenever an error occured durint the AgentMessage lifecycle.

```
{
  type: "agent_error";
  created: number;
  configurationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
  };
}
```

      </Property>
    </Properties>

    ### Optional JSON body attributes

    <Properties>
      <Property name="message" type="object">
        An initial user message object. See the curl command for an example of a message object
        mentioning the `@dust` assistant. Available global assistant `configurationId` are:
        `helper`, `dust`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`, `claude-2`, `claude-instant-1`, `slack`,
        `google_drive`, `notion`, `github`. To mention custom assistants, you can find the assistant
