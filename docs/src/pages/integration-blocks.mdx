# Integration Blocks

An overview of Dust's integration blocks. You'll learn about their functionality and usage. {{
className: 'lead' }}

Integration blocks are [Blocks](/overview#blocks) used to integrate with external systems, mostly
for retrieving data. They can be used to search the web, retrieve content or more generally make API
calls.

For each block we describe its _specification_ parameters and _configuration_ parameters. Please
refer to the [Blocks](/overview#blocks) section for more details on the difference between the two.

## cURL block

The `curl` block is used to make HTTP(s) requests to external systems. As an example you can use it
to call into a [Replit](https://replit.com) endpoint to perform advanced computations or to retrieve
data from an internal or private API.

### Specification

<Properties>
  <Property name="method" type="string">
    The HTTP method to use, one of _GET_, _POST_, _PUT_, _PATCH_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="url" type="string">
    The URL to use for the request. Only _http_ and _https_ schemes are
    supported. This parameter can rely on templating to dynamically generate the
    URL based on previously executed blocks outputs. See the [LLM
    block](/core-blocks#llm-block) documentation for more details.
  </Property>
  <Property name="headers_code" type="javascript">
    A Javascript function `_fun` which takes a single argument `env` (see the
    [Code block](/core-blocks#code-block) documentation for details) and returns
    _null_ (no headers) or an object representing the headers to use for the
    request.
  </Property>
  <Property name="body_code" type="javascript">
    A Javascript function `_fun` which takes a single argument `env` (see the
    [Code block](/core-blocks#code-block) documentation for details) and returns
    _null_ (no body) or a string representing the body to use for the request.
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Configuration

<Properties>
  <Property name="use_cache" type="bool">
    Whether to rely on the automated caching mechanism of the block. If set to
    _true_ and a previous request was made with the same specification
    parameters, then the cached response is returned.
  </Property>
</Properties>

---

## Search block

The `search` block is used to search the web. It is currently a wrapper around
[SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/) and [Serper](https://serper.dev) (we plan to also add Google
Programmable Search Engine). It requires setting up the SerpApi and/or Serper provider in your
account's provider settings.

### Specification

<Properties>
  <Property name="engine" type="optional string">
    The SerpApi engine to use, defaults to _google_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="query" type="string">
    The query to use for the search. This parameter can rely on templating to
    dynamically generate the query based on previously executed blocks outputs.
    See the [LLM block](/core-blocks#llm-block) documentation for more details.
  </Property>
  <Property name="num" type="optional integer">
    The number of results to return. Defaults to _10_.
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Configuration

<Properties>
  <Property name="provider_id" type="string">
    The search provider to use. One of _serpapi_, _serper_.
  </Property>
  <Property name="use_cache" type="bool">
    Whether to rely on the automated caching mechanism of the block. If set to
    _true_ and a previous search was made with the same specification
    parameters, then the cached response is returned.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Browser block

The `browser` block is used to scrape content from web pages. It is a wrapper around
[Browserless.io](https://browserless.io/). It requires setting up the Browserless provider in your
account's provider settings.

### Specification

<Properties>
  <Property name="url" type="string">
    The URL to scrape. This parameter can rely on templating to dynamically
    generate the URL based on previously executed blocks outputs. See the [LLM
    block](/core-blocks#llm-block) documentation for more details.
  </Property>
  <Property name="selector" type="string">
    The CSS selector to use to select the content to scrape. Use _body_ to
    scrape the entire page.
  </Property>
  <Property name="timeout" type="optional integer">
    The timeout in ms to use for the scrape request. Defaults to _16000_. Passed
    to underlying Puppeteer's
    [page.goto](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.page.goto) method. See
    Browserless [scrape](https://www.browserless.io/docs/scrape) method
    documentation for details.
  </Property>
  <Property name="wait_until" type="optional string">
    One of _load_, _domcontentloaded_, _networkidle0_, _networkidle2_. Passed to
    underlying Puppeteer's [page.goto](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.page.goto)
    method. See Browserless [scrape](https://www.browserless.io/docs/scrape)
    method documentation for details.
  </Property>
  <Property name="wait_for" type="optional string">
    Wait for an event to happen to return content. Accepts one of three options:
    a function to be ran, a number indicating the time in ms to wait, or a valid
    selector to wait for. See Browserless
    [scrape](https://www.browserless.io/docs/scrape) method documentation for
    details.
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Configuration

<Properties>
  <Property name="use_cache" type="bool">
    Whether to rely on the automated caching mechanism of the block. If set to
    _true_ and a previous request was made with the same specification
    parameters, then the cached response is returned.
  </Property>
  <Property name="error_as_output" type="bool">
    By default the block will error if the scrape request times out,
    interrupting the flow of execution of the app. If set to _true_ then the
    block will return the error as an object and execution will continue.
  </Property>
</Properties>
