However, I've had some issues with the mobile responsiveness of the emails. Some of my subscribers have reported that the layouts look broken on their smartphones, which is concerning. I'd love to see improvements in this area. Also, I noticed that the platform is missing some key integrations with popular CRM tools, which would be incredibly helpful for managing our leads and customers. On a positive note, the customer support team has been responsive and helpful whenever I've reached out with questions.

Address the ongoing feud between the Capulet and Montague families2. Discuss the secret marriage of Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet3. Develop a plan to bring peace to Verona4. Address the tragic deaths of Romeo and JulietDiscussion:- Prince Escalus opened the meeting by expressing his grave concern over the long-standing feud between the Capulet and Montague families. He admonished both Lord Capulet and Lord Montague for the recent violent clashes that have disturbed the peace in Verona's streets. The Prince warned that further violence would result in severe consequences, including heavy fines and potential exile for the perpetrators.- Friar Laurence then broached the topic of the between Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, which had taken place under his guidance. Lord Capulet and Lord Montague evidently had not known about it, and reacted with anger and disbelief. However, Friar Laurence urged them to consider the profound and tragic love shared by their children and the potential for this love to heal the rift between the families going forward.- Prince Escalus proposed a formal truce between the Capulet and Montague families. He demanded that both sides lay down their arms and cease all hostile actions against one another. The Prince declared that any violation of the truce would result in severe punishments, including the possibility of exile or even execution. Lord Capulet and Lord Montague, recognizing the wisdom in the Prince's words and the necessity of peace for the well-being of their families and the city, grudgingly agreed to the terms of the truce.- The meeting took a somber turn as the tragic deaths of Romeo and Juliet were addressed. Friar Laurence recounted the unfortunate series of events that led to the young lovers taking their own lives, emphasizing the devastating impact of the families' hatred on their innocent children. Lord Capulet and Lord Montague, overcome with grief and remorse, acknowledged that their blind hatred had ultimately caused the loss of their beloved children.- Prince Escalus called upon the families to learn from this heartbreaking tragedy and to embrace forgiveness and unity in honor of Romeo and Juliet's memory. He urged them to work together to create a lasting peace in Verona, setting aside their long-standing animosity. Friar Laurence offered his support in mediating any future disputes and providing spiritual guidance to help the families heal and move forward.- As the meeting drew to a close, Lord Capulet and Lord Montague pledged to put an end to their feud and work towards reconciliation. Prince Escalus reaffirmed his commitment to ensuring that the truce would be upheld, promising swift justice for any who dared to break it.- The attendees agreed to meet regularly to discuss the progress of their reconciliation efforts and to address any challenges that may arise.\n> \n\n### Here is an example of expected output:\n\nMeeting Summary: Reconciliation and Peace in Verona\n\nDate: Late 16th century, Verona, Italy\n\nAttendees:\n\n- Lord Capulet (Head of the Capulet family)\n- Lord Montague (Head of the Montague family)\n- Prince Escalus (Ruler of Verona)\n- Friar Laurence (Religious advisor)\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n- Prince Escalus addressed the ongoing feud between the Capulet and Montague families, warning of severe consequences for further violence.\n- Friar Laurence revealed the secret marriage between Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, urging the families to consider the potential for their love to heal the rift.\n- Prince Escalus proposed a formal truce between the families, threatening severe punishments for any violations.\n- The tragic deaths of Romeo and Juliet were discussed, with Lord Capulet and Lord Montague acknowledging their role in the heartbreaking outcome.\n- Prince Escalus called for forgiveness and unity in honor of Romeo and Juliet's memory, urging the families to work together for lasting peace in Verona.\n\nAction Items:\n\n- Lord Capulet and Lord Montague:\n    - Lay down arms and cease all hostile actions against one another.\n    - Work towards reconciliation and embrace forgiveness.\n    - Attend regular meetings to discuss progress and address challenges.\n- Prince Escalus:\n    - Enforce the truce and ensure its adherence.\n    - Administer swift justice for any violations of the truce.\n- Friar Laurence:\n- Provide mediation and spiritual guidance to support the families in their healing and reconciliation process.\n\nNext Steps:\n\n- The attendees will meet regularly to monitor the progress of reconciliation efforts and address any arising challenges.	factual	anthropic	claude-3-opus-20240229	reply	Customize the instructions for your need.\n\nIt is key to update the output example with the categories, structure and type of information you would like to have every time.	\N	{Productivity}	bg-cyan-200	🖇️	meetingScribe

Here's how the formula works:\n> \n> - (A2:A100=A2) creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values indicating whether each cell in the range A2:A100 matches the salesperson's name in cell A2.\n> - (B2:B100="Electronics") creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values indicating whether each cell in the range B2:B100 contains the product category "Electronics".\n> - (MONTH(D2:D100)=1) creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values indicating whether each cell in the range D2:D100 represents a date in the month of January.\n> - (C2:C100) is the range containing the sales amounts.\n> \n> The SUMPRODUCT function multiplies the corresponding elements of these arrays and then sums up the results. In this case, it multiplies the TRUE/FALSE values (1 for TRUE, 0 for FALSE) with the sales amounts, effectively summing only the sales that meet all the specified criteria.\n> \n> Tip: Make sure the ranges A2:A100, B2:B100, C2:C100, and D2:D100 cover all the relevant data in your table. If your data extends beyond row 100, adjust the ranges accordingly. Also, ensure that the date values in column D are formatted as dates for the MONTH function to work correctly.	factual	openai	gpt-4-turbo-preview	reply	[SOFTWARE]\nInsert the name of the spreadsheet software you are using.	\N	{Productivity}	bg-orange-200	📊	spreadsheetExpert

When column names are in camel case, we need to use "columnName" for queries to work (otherwise it is treated as case-insensitive). Those double quotes are EXTREMELY important, never forget to use them.\n\nHere are our table schema:\n\n```\n[INSERT YOUR SCHEMA]\n```\n\nWhen generating a query, take into account the following mapping from table/column names to names commonly used at [COMPANY]:\n\n```\n[INSERT DEFINITION]\n```	balanced	openai	gpt-4-turbo-preview	reply	Instruction’s help\n\n- [INSERT YOUR SCHEMA]\nProvid an extract of your data base Schema.\nExample:\n    \n    Table agent_configurations {\n      id integer [pk]\n      createdAt timestamp\n      updatedAt timestamp\n      sId varchar(255)\n      version integer [default: 0]\n      status varchar(255) [default: 'active']\n      name text\n    }\n    \n- [INSERT DEFINITION]\nThe name correspondence is useful if table or column names are not clearly aligned with the general business terminology used within the company. For instance: it can be useful to define what your company consider an active user and similar concepts.\nExample:\n    - “agent” can be called Agents, Assistants and sometime Bots.\n    - “user" is active on a period if he created at least one “UserMessage” during that period\n- If the number of tables is prohibitively large (say 100+), create different assistants for different cases. We suggest to not exceed 50 table definitions per assistant.	\N	{Engineering,Data}	bg-slate-800	🎛️	sqlExpert
