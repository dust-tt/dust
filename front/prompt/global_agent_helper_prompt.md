# About Dust

## What is Dust?

Dust is a platform powered by GPT4-Turbo, Claude 2.1, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. It's designed to help teams work better with AI. These AI assistants are there to enhance your understanding of any topic, increase productivity, and improve work processes. They can help with company questions, draft documents, or simplify complex tasks. You can create personal assistants and shared assistants with your team.

## General concepts

### Assistants

Dust assistants are AI-powered agents that employ frontier models like GPT4-Turbo, Claude 2.1, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. You can use two types of assistants inside Dust.

- Frontier model assistants: They are based on advanced large-scale models like GPT4, Gemini Pro, Mistral Medium, and Claude2 created by major AI developers (OpenAI, Google DeepMind, etc.). @gpt4, @claude, @gemini-pro, and @mistral-medium can handle a variety of tasks, such as summarization, translation, and content generation, and help you answer questions.
- Custom assistants: created by Dust, yourself (personal assistants), or builders (workspace assistants). Custom assistants package specific use cases, are powered by the LLM of your choice, and are instructed to complete specific tasks. @notion or @slack created by Dust interact with synced documents from those platforms. You can create a custom Data assistant for SQL query generation, customer support, UX feedback, or specialized document creation like a memo.

To illustrate, while @dust handles organizational questions, @help provides Dust support, @slack searches Slack, and @gpt4, @claude, @gemini-pro, @mistral-medium offers direct large language model access. Multiple assistants can be chained to complete complex tasks. To make the most of Dust, our recommendation is to create custom assistants with a very specific objective detailed in the Instruction part and selected knowledge.

### Assistants Gallery

From there, you can create your personal list of assistants. Click on `+Add` to add an assistant to your list. Assistants can be created by yourself, your teammates, or Dust.

### Conversation

Interactions with assistants happen in "conversations" where users ask questions or requests, and the assistants respond using accessible data.

Sharing conversation links grants collaborative access to all workspace members, enhancing teamwork.

Create conversations for new topics to keep the assistants focused!

### Workspace

In Dust, a Workspace is where users work with assistants and customize them for themselves or their team's needs. Admins manage data access, invite members, and set roles for better teamwork.

### Connections & Folders

In Dust, "Connections" are integrated platforms like Notion or Slack where assistants pull data from, available only on paid plans. Admins decide which data assistants can access.

Folders are custom data sources created by builders to provide assistants with specific information unavailable inside Connections. Folders are available for all plans.

### Synchronizing

Synchronizing data with Dust means Dust will extract it and that the data will be available for data retrieval by the assistants.

### Retrieve

In Dust, assistants use "Retrieve" to get data from approved sources like Notion or Slack to answer user questions with relevant, specific information. Admins control which data the assistants can access for security.

### Embedding

LLM embedding converts text into numerical vectors, positioning similar phrases near each other in a high-dimensional space. This lets models like GPT-4 recognize patterns and meanings in text, which in Dust, helps assistants to find and pull information from relevant documents to answer user queries accurately.

## Workspace Settings

### How to invite members to the workspace

As an Admin, invite members by going to `⚙️` > `Members` then use the `Member list` to invite by email or set a whitelisted domain in Invitation Link > Settings and share the link.

After members join, assign roles: admin, builder, or user.

### What are the users’ different roles?

**Users**: Use the assistants and create personal assistants in the Workspace.

**Builders**: Users plus:

- Build custom assistants with Dust tools and Folders.
- Add Folders to the Workspace.

**Admins**: Builders plus:

- Add members to the Workspace.
- Change member roles.
- Manage Workspace Connections.

### **How do I install the @Dust assistant in Slack?**

To use Dust in Slack for paid plans:

1. Admins must install and authorize the Dust app in Slack.
2. In Slack settings, select the channels to synchronize with Dust (excluding private channels).
3. The @Dust bot will join these channels automatically.

THEN, in the Dust app, while signed in as an admin, confirm that you want to synchronize the channels

In private channels, @dust can answer questions but won't synchronize messages.

After installation, all workspace members can interact with @dust by:

- Mentioning @dust in channels.
- Inviting @dust to private channels (data from private channels are not synchronized with Dust).
- Starting a direct message with @dust.

Advanced features to use the Dust Slackbot.

- If you want to add Dust to a group direct message, [convert them to a private channel first](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/217555437-Convert-a-group-direct-message-to-a-private-channel).
- Users can interact with any other assistants via Slack by summoning @dust and adding a tilde "~" right before the assistant's name- i.e., "@dust ~gpt4 Hello!" if you want to interact with @gpt4.
- Builders can link a custom assistant to a **public** Slack channel when creating or editing a custom assistant, the assistant will automatically be used every time Dust is called in the public channel. Go to `Assistants` > `Workspace assistants` > `New` or `Edit` > `Slack Integration` to do this. You can't link an assistant to a private channel; to use an assistant inside a private channel, use the syntax `@dust ~name of the assistant` .

To export your @dust conversation history in Slack, remember that it's like exporting direct messages. You can only do this if you're an Owner or admin of a Slack Business+ or Enterprise Grid account.

## Data

### How to add a Connection

**How to set up Connections**

Connections are available only for paid plans.

As an Admin, go to ️`Build` > `Connections` > Select the desired Connection, click `Connect` > Authenticate your account, and select the data you wish to synchronize with Dust.

##Slack

The admin needs to select the Slack channels you want to synchronize with Dust; the @dust bot will automatically join the selected channels. However, make sure that the Dust app is already installed and authorized in your workspace.

##Notion

To synchronize Notion pages, the admin can only select top-level pages. To add lower-level pages, the admin can use the search bar and select the desired pages. Notion API doesn’t allow navigation.

To verify if a Notion page is synchronized with Dust, as Notion admin, go to the selected page, click on `...`on the top right, and check if Dust is one of the `connections`. You can manually synchronize the page by adding Dust as a connection directly from the Notion page.

##Intercom
Dust is able to synchronize Help Center articles and Conversations. When setting up the Intercom connection, the admin needs to select the list of Help Center Collections and the list of Teams you want to synchronize with Dust. Here is the documentation/guide for the Intercom connection: https://dust-tt.notion.site/Intercom-connection-on-Dust-193f0670d39a44de85cd472c6035ea84

**How to update Connections**

As an admin, ️ ️`Build` > `Connections` > Select the desired Connection, click `Manage` > `Add/Remove data` > Explore, and either select or deselect the data you want to synchronize with Dust.

### What are Connections' current limits?

Slack: Dust doesn't take into account private channels, group direct messages, external files, or content behind a URL.
Notion: Dust doesn't take into account external files or content behind a URL.
Google Drive: Dust doesn't take into account files with more than 750Kb of extracted text. Supported files include GDocs, GSlides, and .txt files but not PDFs.
Github: Dust only gathers data from issues, discussions, and top-level pull request comments (but not in-code comments in pull requests, nor the actual source code or other GitHub data)
Public Websites: Up to 500 web pages from a public website can be synchronized.
Confluence: Dust does not synchronize private spaces. Dust does not access pages with view limitations and will not capture any content from a restricted page. This restriction also applies to all the child pages of such pages.
Intercom: Dust will index only the conversations from the selected Teams that were initiated within the past 90 days and concluded (marked as closed). For the Help Center data, Dust will index every Article published within a selected Collection.

### How long does synchronizing new messages or documents created in one of my Connections takes?

Dust syncs quickly, usually in minutes. To check the last sync as an admin:

- Go to `Build` > `Connections`.
- Look for "last sync ~ x s ago."

To see if a document has synced and view its contents:

- Use the search bar to find and select the document.

### How to add data that are not supported as a Connection by Dust

As a user, you can add your data to a connected platform like Notion or Google Drive. Ask an admin to verify if the data you added are synchronized with Dust.

Admins/builders can add a Folders by:

- Going to `Assistants`> `Folders`.
- Clicking `Add a new Folder`.
- Naming it and adding a description (optional).
- Clicking `create`.

### What are the documents and PDF current limits?

Documents up to 2MB can be uploaded manually via Folders and 10MB from the conversation.

### **Does Dust use user and company data to train its models?**

No, Dust does not use user or company data to retrain its models. Any data sent is retained for a limited time and this is strictly for debugging purposes.

### How many words are there in a 750KB document?

A 750KB plain text document could contain around 125,000 words, assuming an average of 5 characters per word. But remember, this is a rough estimate. The actual word count can vary based on the document's format and content.

### How to configure which data sources @dust has access to

To configure the @dust assistant, got to `Assistants` > `Dust Assistants` and click on the `Manage` button next to the @dust assistant. You'll be enable / disable @dust and select which data sources it has access to.

Think about @dust as your general assistant to explore all the data synchronized with Dust. Don’t expect 100% accurate answers but use Dust as a router to navigate your knowledge.

## Dust’s plans

### **Dust Free plan**

- Creation of custom workflows.
- Create and use the assistants on a data source with up to 32 documents of 750KB each.
- Access to GPT3.5.

# Assistants

### What can I use an assistant for?

Assistants can answer questions and chat with you. Think about your assistants as an extension of yourself to create content in a specific format. Each assistant is different, so check their descriptions to see which one(s) to use. Try to chain assistants to complete complex tasks.

- Use @dust for questions about your company; it uses GPT-4 and knows public data until April 2023.
- Use @help for help with Dust features.
- Use @slack to find info in Slack.
- Use @gpt4, @gemini-pro, @mistral-medium, or @claude for tasks with the latest AI models.

You can combine assistants, like asking @dust for customer insights and then having @claude and @gpt4 help write a memo based on that info. But the most important thing to make the most of Dust is creating custom assistants: personal assistants or shared assistants with your team.

### Technically, how do assistants work?

Assistants follow these steps:

1. **Analysis**: They interpret what you're asking.
2. **Search**: They look through your company's data for information that can help answer your question.
3. **Retrieve**: They pull up the most relevant information.
4. **Response**: They use this information to craft a reply to your query.

Different assistants have varying levels of memory or "context windows." For instance, GP4-Turbo and Claude can “remember” more of the conversation than others. But even their memory isn't unlimited. In lengthy discussions, earlier parts may be forgotten.

## Dust assistants

Dust offers 3 types of assistants:

- Data source assistants to interact directly with your Slack, Google Drive, Github or Notion in a conversational way, or all of them together via @dust.
- Models assistants to interact with the strongest models available, currently GPT-4, Claude, and Mistral: @gpt4, @gpt3.5, @claude, @claude-instant, @gemini-pro, @mistral-medium.
- Dust assistants like the @help to guide you when using Dust.

### How to search for assistants?

Users can search for assistants inside the `Assistant Gallery`. Admin and builders can filter custom assistants via the search bar on top of the Assistants List in `Assistants` .

## Custom assistants

### What are custom assistants?

Custom assistants are AI agents created by users and builders in your workspace. They are made to achieve specific tasks defined by builders. They can be personal or shared with the team.

### How to create a custom assistant?

To create a custom assistant:

As a user, Navigate to `Chat` > `My Assistants` > `+New`.

As a builder or admin:

1. To create a Personal or Shared assistant: Navigate to `Chat` > `My Assistants` > `+New`.
2. To create a Company assistant for all members of the workspace: Navigate to `Build` > `Manage Assistants` > `+New`. You can also duplicate existing assistants from the Assistants Gallery.

Setup involves:

- **Instructions**: Write clear, detailed prompts for the assistant.
- **Advanced Settings**: Pick a model and set the creativity level (temperature).
  - **Deterministic (0)**: Straightforward, factual answers.
  - **Factual (0.2)**: A slight bit of unpredictability.
  - **Balanced (0.7)**: More variety in responses.
  - **Creative (1.0)**: High creativity for brainstorming.
- **Actions**:
  - No action: to use the model with no data source retrieval.
  - Search in data sources: To use semantic search to retrieve data.
  - Advanced actions:
    - Use most recent in data sources: to process all data between now and X. Adapt the timeframe to the model's context window. Avoid +1month timeframe if you know your data set is large.
    - Run a Dust app: If you want to chain a Dust App to your custom assistant.

### How to create a Dust LLM app?

Dust apps are Large Language Model (LLM) apps

For Dust apps (advanced tasks using models like APIs or Data Sources):

1. Go to `Admin` > `Developers` > `Tools`.
2. Click `Create App`, name it, and set access permissions.

To create and deploy Dust apps, you must provide your own model API keys— Dust doesn’t provide API keys like we do to create and use assistants.

### How to edit a custom assistant?

To edit and improve your custom assistant's performance in these quick steps:

Tap 🤖 in the chat bar to manage and edit your custom assistants.

or

1. Go to `Assistants`.
2. Choose your assistant.
3. Click `Edit`.
4. Make necessary changes and `save` them.

### Why chose GPT-4 or Claude 2?

Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School who writes about AI, concludes that GPT-4 is better at solving math problems, while Claude 2 is better at writing.

| Model          | See images | Internet connection | Personality               | When to use it                                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GPT-3.5        |            | No                  | Neutral                   | Fast and capable, but other models are now stronger.                                |
| GPT-4          | Soon       | No                  | Helpful, a little preachy | Strongest model if you want to complete more complex task.                          |
| GPT4-Turbo     | Soon       | No                  | Neutral                   | Strongest model if you want to complete more complex task.                          |
| Claude 2       |            | No                  | Pleasant                  |                                                                                     |
| Claude 2.1     |            | No                  | Pleasant                  | Strongest model with a large amount of text. Answer with fewer words than Claude 2. |
| Claude Instant |            | No                  | Pleasant                  | Same as Claude 2 but will answer faster and with fewer words.                       |

## Using an assistant

## Conversation

You can create conversations that involve both colleagues and several AI agents, each assistant having a unique purpose and capability.

### How do I access an assistant?

To use an assistant:

- Type your message and mention the assistant with "@", or click the robot icon 🤖 in the message bar.
- Always start with "@" when calling an assistant, or it won't respond.
- In Slack, if enabled by your admin, use the @dust assistant in the same way.
- For the Dust Slackbot, use the syntax "@dust ~gpt4" and your question to engage with @gpt4 for example.

### How do I talk to an assistant?

When engaging with assistants, we recommend using multiple assistants within a single conversation to tackle complex tasks. Start with "@" followed by the assistant's name to initiate interaction with each one. For instance, you could use one assistant to gather information and another to help organize that information into a document. This multi-assistant approach allows for a more collaborative and comprehensive assistance strategy.

### Can I share a conversation?

To share a conversation:

1. Go to the conversation.
2. Click 'Share' at the top right.
3. Your colleagues can then join and work with you and the assistants.

### Can I delete or rename a conversation?

To delete a conversation, go to the conversation and click '🗑️' at the top right of the screen. To rename a conversation, click on `🖊️` on the right of the conversation's title.

### Can I use the Dust assistants in different languages?

Dust assistants use OpenAI GPT4 and Anthropic Claude. They're best at English but can also handle other languages. GPT4 and Claude know common programming languages, too.

### Can assistants create a new file or document directly into Notion, Google Drive, or other connected platforms?

To move text to Notion or Google Docs:

- Write the text in Dust.
- Copy it.
- Paste it into a new Notion page or Google Doc.

Note: Assistants can't create documents in connected platforms for you.

### What are things to ask @gpt4?

GPT-4 Turbo is OpenAI’s top model and is good for tasks needing advanced thinking. It's better at coding tests and math and is helpful for people without coding or computer experience.

GPT-4 Turbo can use basic real-time data like date and time, and can give output in multiple languages.

It was trained on public data until December 2023, so it doesn't know about events after that. @gpt4 uses GPT-4 Turbo.

For builder roles, GPT-4 Turbo offers 128k tokens context window or 300 pages of text.

### What are things to ask @claude?

Claude is often more accurate in tasks requiring factual knowledge and tends to generate creative content. Users find Claude's answers to be concise and clear.

Claude was trained on data until early 2023. It won't know about events after that. @claude uses Claude 2.1.

For builders, Claude 2.1 can handle the most context: 200k tokens, or 150,000 words, or over 500 pages of text.

### What are things to ask @mistral-medium?

A 7B dense Transformer, fast-deployed and easily customizable. Small yet powerful for a variety of use cases. Supports English and code, and a 8k context window.

### What are things to ask @gemini-pro?

The Gemini models are trained to support 32k context length. Gemini Pro comes with strong reasoning, math, coding, and language understanding skills.

### What data do the assistants have access to?

Dust only has access to data admins decided to synchronize with Dust. admin.

The assistants can use:

- Notion pages chosen by the admin.
- Content from Slack channels chosen by the admin. Dust assistants can't access attachments or links in these channels unless they link to indexed documents.
- Google Drive folders chosen by the admin. Dust supports GDocs, GSlides, and .txt files with less than 750KB of extracted text.
- All GitHub discussions & issues. Dust syncs with a repository's Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions, but not the repository’s code.

Dust doesn’t support pictures and comment within your Google documents or Notion pages.

### Do the assistants have access to the Internet?

No, the assistants don't search the internet. They respond using their own resources. But you can give them text from the internet to work with. You can also create data sources with online documents.

### Does the Dust assistant give accurate and safe responses?

assistants are experimental and their responses may not always be correct. Always check the `Retrieved` bar under your question and above the answer.

Although assistants have safety controls and feedback mechanisms according to our [Product Constitution](https://blog.dust.tt/2023-05-15-product-constitution), they can sometimes provide wrong information or statements.

### Is there a Dust conversation API?

Yes there is a Dust conversation API, you can find the documentation here - https://docs.dust.tt/conversations

---

# Developer Tools

### What is the difference between a Dust app and an assistant?

The Dust Developer Platform enables the creation of Dust apps powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Claude. These apps perform specific tasks by making calls to models, APIs, or Data Sources.

Dust apps add a functional layer over a model, enabling it to operate in a particular manner suited to the task at hand.

Assistants, on the other hand, are more complex. They integrate a large language model with context understanding, planning abilities, and tool operation to respond to queries or complete tasks directed towards a defined objective, drawing on their built-in knowledge and the user's input.

### How to create custom apps?

As an Admin or a builder, to create Dust custom apps go to ️Admin > `Developers`> `Tools` > select `Create App` . From there, you can give the app a name and decide who can access the app.

To learn how to develop an app you can explore Dust technical documentation here - https://docs.dust.tt/

## Troubles using Dust and limitations of the assistant

### When asking a question about data within Slack, the link to the thread isn’t always the right one

In a given channel, messages that are not part of a slack thread are grouped together by Dust according to the time they were sent. The link provided by dust is then for the first message of the group. The message that matched your question might be further down.
To optimize dust retrieval of a piece of information on Slack, we recommend creating a first message with only the title, then following up in a thread from the message with all the information.

### I haven’t received a login, or I am having trouble logging in

If you experience issues logging in please send a message to your workspace Admin or our team [team@dust.tt](mailto:team@dust.tt) will investigate.

### The assistant is producing links that don’t work and falsely claiming something untrue. What’s going on?

Assistants are limited to text responses and can't browse the internet or use unapproved tools. They rely on approved data sources and Admin permissions.

GPT4 and Claude are transformer-based models. They're trained to predict the next word in a sentence using probability, not grammar. For example, if you input 'chair', it predicts the next word based on patterns. But it doesn't really "understand" what a chair is. That's why the assistant might sometimes make mistakes or "hallucinate".

### Why doesn't the assistant remember what I said earlier in a conversation?

Assistants have a limited memory for conversation context. They may forget earlier parts of a long chat, which can result in incorrect responses. As Dust and Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve, assistants' ability to handle longer conversations will improve.

### Can Dust remember and incorporate my feedback in the future?

Assistants have a short memory and don't recall past conversations. To give assistants guidance on your writing or thinking style, include a "constitution"—a list of rules and principles—in the assistant's instructions.
