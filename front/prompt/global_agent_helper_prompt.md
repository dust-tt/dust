# About Dust

## What is Dust?

Dust is a platform powered by GPT4, Claude, and Mistral. It's designed to help teams work better with AI. These AI assistants are there to enhance your understanding of any topic, increase productivity, and improve work processes. They can help with company questions, draft documents, or simplify complex topics.

## General concepts

### Assistant

Dust assistants are AI-powered agents that employ frontier models like GPT-4, Mistral and Claude. You can use two types of assistants inside Dust.

- Frontier models assistants: Frontier models are large-scale models that exceed the capabilities currently present in the most advanced existing models created by providers such as **OpenAI, Google DeepMind,** **Anthropic, Meta, Mistral** or **Microsoft;**
  Frontier models assistants like @gpt4, for example, can be used for completing general tasks like recognizing, summarizing, translating, and generating text and other forms of content.
- Custom assistants: assistants created by Dust or builders from your company workspace to answer specific use cases. Custom assistants can be augmented with retrieval or see their instructions customized.
  Custom assistants can be used for completing specific tasks defined by Dust or the builders. Dust created custom assistants like @notion or @slack to help you interact directly with your Notion or Slack synchronized documents. Builders at your company can also create custom assistants to help you complete many tasks like improving SQL queries, supporting the customer success team, giving feedback on UX writing content, or writing specific memos or reports.

To illustrate, while @dust handles organizational questions, @help provides Dust support, @slack searches Slack, and @gpt4/@claude offer direct large language model access. Multiple assistants can be leveraged concurrently to tackle varied tasks.

### Conversation

Interactions with assistants happen in "conversations" where users ask questions or requests, and the assistants respond using accessible data.

Sharing conversation links grants collaborative access to all workspace members, enhancing teamwork.

Create conversations for new topics to keep the assistants focused!

### Workspace

A Workspace in Dust is the main environment where users create conversations and interact with the Dust assistants. Each workspace is unique and can be personalized to cater to specific team use cases. Workspace admins have the ability to view top-level resources of a Managed Data Source and can control the visibility and accessibility of data within the workspace. They can also invite other members to the workspace and assign them roles, enhancing collaboration and knowledge sharing.

### Data Source

In Dust, a "Data Source" refers to the locations from which the Dust assistants retrieve information to provide responses. It can be either Managed or Static. Managed Data Sources are platforms like Notion, Google Drive, GitHub or Slack that Dust synchronize with directly. Managed Data Sources are available to paid plans only. Admins can control which parts of these platforms Dust can access. Static Data Sources are custom data sources created by builders to provide assistants with specific information not available in a Managed Data Source. Static Data Sources are available to all plans.

### Retrieve

In Dust, the “Retrieve” function enables the assistants to pull information from permitted data sources in order to respond to user queries; it allows access to relevant data so the assistants can provide precise, context-aware answers. Retrieved information can come from Managed Sources like Notion or Slack, or from custom Static Data Sources. The assistants are limited to retrieving data from sources approved by the admin for security.

### Embedding

Large Language Models (LLMs) embedding refers to the process of transforming text data into numerical vectors that can be processed by LLMs like GPT-4 or Claude. This involves converting the text into a high-dimensional space where similar words or phrases are placed close together, allowing the model to understand the semantic similarity between different pieces of text. In Dust, LLMs embedding is utilized to enable the assistants to retrieve relevant documents to respond to user queries.

## Workspace Settings

### How to invite members to the workspace

As an Admin, go to 🗝️ Admin > `Workspace` > Members. You can invite members by email via `Member list` or define a whitelisted email domain in `Invitation Link` > `Settings` and then share the invitation Link.
Once the members accept the invitation, select their users role: admin, builder or user.

### What are the users’ different roles?

**Users**: Access and utilize the assistants within the Workspace.

**Builders**: Beyond user capabilities, builders can:

- Create custom assistants using Dust platform features and available Data Sources.
- Integrate non-managed Data Sources into the Workspace.

**Admins**: Enjoy the highest level of access. Apart from builder privileges, they can:

- Invite new members to the Workspace.
- Edit member roles.
- Link and update Managed Data Sources to the Workspace.

### \***\*How do I install the @Dust assistant in Slack?\*\***

Dust assistant in Slack is only available to paid plans and you need to connect Slack as a Managed Data Source to activate the bot. To get Dust in Slack, an admin needs to install it. Ensure the Dust app is installed and authorized in your workspace before you invite it to a channel.

To synchronize Slack channels with Dust, the admin needs to invite the Dust app into the channels:

- on Slack, in the channel(s) of your choice, type /invite and then select "add apps to this channel."
- then select Dust
- repeat on the channels you want

THEN, in the Dust app, while signed in as an admin:

- Confirm that you want to index the channels

Once that's done, everyone in the Slack workspace can use the @dust Slackbot. It only has to be installed once.

If an admin has installed Dust, @dust Slackbot will show up as a bot user. Users can chat with @dust by:

- Mentioning @dust in a public channel.
- @dust doesn't work in private channels.

To export your @dust conversation history in Slack, keep in mind that it's like exporting direct messages. You can only do this if you're an Owner or admin of a Business+ or Enterprise Grid account on Slack.

## Data Sources

### How to add Managed Data Sources

**How to set up Managed Data Sources**

Managed Data Sources are available only for paid plans.

As an Admin, go to 🗝️ Admin > `Data Sources` > Managed Data Sources > Select the desired Managed Data Sources and click `Connect` > Authenticate your account and select the data you wish to synchronize with Dust.

If you want the @dust assistant to default to using specific DataSource for answers, as an Admin, go to `Settings` inside the chosen Managed Data Sources then select "Make this Data Source available to the @dust assistant" below `Availability to @dust`.

##Slack

To synchronize Slack channels with Dust, the admin needs to invite the Dust app into the channels. You can do this by typing @dust in the channel. This will bring the Dust Slackbot into the channel. However, make sure that the Dust app is already installed and authorized in your workspace before you invite it to a channel.

##Notion

To synchronize Notion pages, the admin can only select top level pages. To add lower level pages, the admin can use the search bar and select the desired pages. Notion API doesn’t allow navigation.

**How to update Managed Data Sources**

As an admin, 🗝️ Admin > `Data Sources` > Select the desired Managed Data Sources and click `Manage` > `Edit permissions` > Explore and either select or deselect the data you want to synchronize with Dust.

### How to add data that are not supported as a Managed Data Source by Dust

As a user, you can add your data to a managed data source like Notion or Google Drive. Dust will then automatically sync it through @dust, @notion, or @googledrive.

As an admin or builder go to 🗝️ Admin > `Data Sources` > Static Data Sources > select the button `Add a new Data Source` > give your data source a name and optionally a description. If you want to add this data source to @dust by default select `Make this Data Source available to the @dust assistant` > then validate `create` .

### **Does Dust use user and company data to train its models?**

No, Dust does not use user or company data to retrain its models. Any data sent is retained for a limited time and this is strictly for debugging purposes.

## Dust’s plans

### **Dust Free plan**

- creation of custom workflows
- create and use the assistants on a static data source with up to 32 documents of 750KB each.

If you're looking for additional features such as connecting Notion, Google Drive, GitHub and Slack you will need to upgrade to paid plans available.

### **Dust for Startups**

- 1Go across Data Sources and Managed Data Sources (GitHub, Google Drive, Slack, Notion)
- GPT-4, Claude and Mistral activated for assistants
- up to 5 Dust workspace members. Unlimited Slackbot users.

### Dust for Teams

# Assistants

### What can I use an assistant for?

A Dust assistant can answer questions and chat with you. Each one is different, so check their descriptions on the assistant homepage to see which one(s) to use.

Use @dust for general company questions. It has access to your company data as well as public data up to September 2021 thanks to GPT4

Use @help for help with using Dust.

Use @slack if you think the information is in Slack.

Use @gpt4 or @claude to work directly with the latest models.

You can use several assistants at once. For example, if you're writing a memo about customers, ask @dust for an overview of what you've learned like: “Can you compile a list of our learnings from working with customers?” Then, use @claude and @gpt4 to turn @dust's answer into a memo.

### Technically, how do assistants work?

Technically assistants first try to understand your question (Analysis), then will try to find, in the data from your company they have access to, relevant information (Search). The search returns results (Retrieves). The assistant use the results to write an answer.

Importantly, the ability of the assistants to remember part of the conversation depends on the specific assistant used - Claude, for example, has a better memory or “context window”. However, even Claude's context window is limited. If the conversation involves a long sequence of questions, our assistants may not recall the very first questions asked.

## Dust assistants

Dust offers 3 types of assistants:

- Data source assistants to interact directly with your Slack, Google Drive, Github or Notion in a conversational way, or all of them together via @dust.
- Models assistants to interact with the strongest models available, currently GPT-4, Claude, and Mistral: @gpt4, @gpt3.5, @claude, @claude-instant.
- Dust assistants like the @help to guide you when using Dust.

## Custom assistants

### What are custom assistants

Custom assistants are AI agents created by builders in your workspace. They are made to achieve specific tasks defined by builders.

### How to create a custom assistant?

If you're a builder, you can create a custom assistant. Go to ️`Admin` > `Assistants` > `Create a new Assistant`. There, you can name and describe the assistant. Remember, the name can't have spaces. The description should help your teammates understand the assistant's role.

The key parts to set up when creating a custom assistant are `Instructions`, `Advanced Settings`, and `Actions`.

**Instructions:** These are prompts that guide the assistant. A good prompt has enough information and is well-structured. It includes the instruction or question for the model and can have other details like context, inputs, or examples. This helps the model give better results.

**Advanced Settings:** Here, you choose the model to execute the instructions and set its "creativity level" or temperature.

- Deterministic (Temperature = 0): The assistant gives direct answers based on facts from your data.
- Factual (Temperature = 0.2): Allows for a bit of randomness.
- Balanced (Temperature = 0.7): Introduces more randomness.
- Creative (Temperature = 1.0): The assistant helps brainstorm or boost creativity with full randomness.

**Actions:** This gives the assistant context thanks to Data Sources. The more specific the data source, the better the assistant's answers. If the assistant's task doesn't need specific knowledge, you can skip adding a data source.
You can use a Dust Application to create custom assistants that perform tasks, allowing you to leverage apps for advanced use cases.

Dust apps are Large Language Model (LLM) apps. As an admin or a builder, to create Dust apps go to 🗝️ Admin > Developers > Tools > select Create App. From there, you can give the app a name and decide who can access the app. A Large Language Model app uses one or more calls to models or services like APIs or Data Sources to do a specific task. They're like a layer on top of a model that makes it work a certain way.

### How to edit a custom assistant?

To edit and improve your custom assistant's performance in these quick steps:

or

1. Go to `Admin`.
2. Select `Assistants`.
3. Choose your assistant.
4. Click `Edit`.
5. Make necessary changes and `save` them.

### Why chose GPT-4 or Claude 2 ?

Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School who writes about AI, concludes that GPT-4 is better at solving math problems, while Claude 2 is better at writing.

| Model          | See images | Internet connection | Personality               | When to use it                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GPT-3.5        |            | No                  | Neutral                   | Fast and capable, but other models are now stronger.                                                              |
| GPT-4          | Soon       | No                  | Helpful, a little preachy | Strongest model if you want to complete more complex task.                                                        |
| Claude 2       |            | No                  | Pleasant                  | Strongest model to work with large amounts of text. You may choose Claude 2 if you're working with a lot of text. |
| Claude Instant |            | No                  | Pleasant                  | Same as Claude 2 but will answer faster and with fewer words.                                                     |

Table with results as of summer 2023, based on Ethan Mollick analysis - oneusefulthing.org.

## Using an assistant

## Conversation

You can create conversations that involve both colleagues and several AI agents, each AI agent having a unique purpose and capability.

### How do I access an assistant?

Click on the message bar at the bottom of your screen and summon the desired assistant(s) or select them by clicking on 🤖 in the message bar.

If your Admin has enabled it, you can also use the @dust assistant in Slack. Just call them like you would in Dust to get answers.

Always use "@" before the assistant's name when you call them, like you do in Slack. If you don't, the assistant won't reply, even to your follow-up questions.

### How do I talk to an assistant?

Always use "@" before the assistant's name when you call them, like you do in Slack. If you don't, the assistant won't reply, even to your follow-up questions.

Then ask questions to communicate with an assistant. The best way to ask a question to a Dust assistant is to talk to them like a coworker or friend. Your questions can be simple questions like 'how do I create a memo?' or more complex requests.

### Can share a conversation?

To share a conversation, go to the conversation and click 'Share' at the top right of the screen. When you share a conversation with colleagues they can collaborate with you and the assistants within the conversation.

### Can I delete or rename a conversation?

To delete a conversation, go to the conversation and click '🗑️' at the top right of the screen.
To rename a conversation click on `🖊️` on the right of the title of the conversation.

### Can I use the Dust assistants in different languages?

Dust assistants use OpenAI GPT4 and Anthropic Claude. They're best at English but can also handle other languages. GPT4 and Claude know common programming languages too.

### What are things to ask @gpt3.5-turbo?

GPT-3.5 is OpenAI's fastest model but is not as good as gpt4 for reasoning and will make more mistakes.

### What are things to ask @gpt4?

GPT-4 is OpenAI’s top model and is good for tasks needing advanced thinking. It's better at coding tests and math and is helpful for people without coding or computer experience.

GPT-4 can use basic real-time data like date and time, and can give output in multiple languages.

It was trained on public data until September 2021, so it doesn't know about events after that. @gpt4 uses GPT-4.

For builder roles, GPT-4 offers 8,000 context tokens. The extended model offers 32,000 tokens or 25,000 words of input.

### What are things to ask @claude about?

Claude is often more accurate in tasks requiring factual knowledge and tends to generate creative content. Users find Claude's answers to be concise and clear.

Claude was trained on data until December 2022, and may recognize some early 2023 events. It won't know about events after that. @claude uses Claude 2.

For builders, Claude can handle the most context: 100k tokens, or about 175 pages of text.

### What are things to ask @claude-instant?

Claude-instant can analyze and work with long sections of books, code, documents, transcripts, and more.

For builders, Claude-instant can handle the most context: 100k tokens, or about 175 pages of text.

### What are things to ask @mistral?

Mistral-7B-instruct is a state-of-the-art 7.3 billion parameter language model. Mistral is a base model, proficient in various English language tasks.

### What data do the assistants have access to?

Your workspace Admin needs to add or confirm the inclusion of a data source. The assistants can use:

- Notion pages chosen by the Admin.
- Content from Slack channels chosen by the Admin. Dust assistants can't access attachments or links in these channels unless they link to indexed documents.
- Google Drive folders chosen by the Admin. Dust supports GDocs, GSlides, and .txt files with less than 750KB of extracted text.
- All GitHub discussions & issues. Dust syncs with a repository's Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions, but not the repository’s code.

### Do the assistants have access to the Internet?

No, the assistants don't search the internet. They respond using their own resources. But you can give them text from the internet to work with. You can also create static data sources with online documents.

### Does the Dust assistant give accurate and safe responses?

assistants are experimental and their responses may not always be correct. Always check the `Retrieved` bar under your question and above the answer.

Although assistants have safety controls and feedback mechanisms according to our [Product Constitution](https://blog.dust.tt/2023-05-15-product-constitution), they can sometimes provide wrong information or statements.

### Is there a Dust conversation API?

Yes there is a Dust conversation API, you can find the documentation here - https://docs.dust.tt/conversations

---

# Developer Tools

### What is the difference between Dust apps and an assistant?

The Dust Developer Platform lets you create and launch Large Language Model apps, or Dust apps. The Dust Platform lets you create custom AI assistants using GPT-4 and Claude.

A Large Language Model app uses one or more calls to models or services like APIs or Data Sources to do a specific task. They're like a layer on top of a model that makes it work a certain way.

Assistants are different. They combine a large language model, context, planning skills, and tool use. They're built to give an answer or do a task based on a specific goal. They use their own knowledge and the questions they're asked to do this.

### How to create custom apps?

As an Admin or a builder, to create Dust custom apps go to 🗝️ Admin > `Developers`> `Tools` > select `Create App` . From there, you can give the app a name and decide who can access the app.

To learn how to develop an app you can explore Dust technical documentation here - https://docs.dust.tt/

## Troubles using Dust and limitations of the assistant

### I haven’t received a login or I am having trouble logging in

If you experience issues logging in please send a message to your workspace Admin or our team team@dust.tt will investigate.

### The assistant is producing links that don’t work and falsely claiming something that’s not true. What’s going on?

Assistants can sometimes overstate their abilities. Despite what they might imply, assistants can't use the internet or any tools or software not approved by the Admin. They can only use approved data sources and provide text responses.

GPT4 and Claude are transformer-based models. They're trained to predict the next word in a sentence using probability, not grammar. For example, if you input 'chair', it predicts the next word based on patterns. But it doesn't really "understand" what a chair is. That's why the assistant might sometimes make mistakes or "hallucinate".

### Why doesn't the assistant remember what I said earlier in a conversation?

Currently, your assistants can only keep track of a limited context, which means they might not remember the beginning of a long conversation at certain points, possibly leading to inaccurate responses. However, as Dust and LLMs continue to improve, the assistants will become more proficient at managing longer conversations.
