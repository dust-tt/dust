# About Dust

## What is Dust?

Dust is a platform powered by GPT4, Claude, Gemini, and Mistral. It's designed to help teams work better with AI. These AI assistants are there to enhance your understanding of any topic, increase productivity, and improve work processes. They can help with company questions, draft documents, or simplify complex tasks. You can create personal assistants and shared assistants with your team.

## General concepts

### Assistants

Dust assistants are AI-powered agents that employ frontier models like GPT4, Claude3, Gemini, and Mistral. You can use frontier model assistants to prompt a model directly from the chat bar, but the best way to use Dust is to create custom assistants.

You can create 4 types of assistants:

- assistants to interact with a selected corpus of knowledge. The role of those assistants is to answer questions based on a source of true knowledge like your culture book, your engineering documentation, or your sales documentation. Be selective to improve the quality of the answers.
- assistants to explore a large corpus of knowledge. Its role is less to answer accurately but rather to help re-discover and resurface past decisions, content, material to repackage it.
- assistants to create documents from a template: emails, memos, blog articles, product documentation.
- assistants to query tables and ask questions to a database in natural language.

Multiple assistants can be chained to complete complex tasks. To make the most of Dust, we recommend creating custom assistants with a specific objective detailed in the Instruction part and selected knowledge.

### Conversation

Interactions with assistants happen in "conversations" where users ask questions or requests, and the assistants respond using accessible data.

Sharing conversation links grants collaborative access to all workspace members, enhancing teamwork.

Create conversations for new topics to keep the assistants focused!

### Workspace

In Dust, a Workspace is where users work with assistants and customize them for themselves or their team's needs. Admins manage data access, invite members, and set roles for better teamwork.

### Connections, Public Websites & Folders

In Dust, "Connections" are integrated platforms like Notion or Slack from which assistants pull data. Admins decide which data assistants can access.

Public Websites are public websites you want to synchronize with Dust. We don’t force enforced protections preventing crawling.

Folders are custom data sources created by builders to provide assistants with specific information unavailable inside Connections. Folders are available for all plans.

### Synchronizing

Synchronizing data with Dust means Dust will extract it and that the data will be available for data retrieval by the assistants.

### Retrieve

In Dust, assistants use "Retrieve" to get data from approved sources like Notion or Slack to answer user questions with relevant, specific information. Admins control which data the assistants can access for security.

### Embedding

LLM embedding converts text into numerical vectors, positioning similar phrases near each other in a high-dimensional space. This lets models like GPT-4 recognize patterns and meanings in text, which in Dust, helps assistants to find and pull information from relevant documents to answer user queries accurately.

# Workspace Settings

### How to invite members to the workspace

As an Admin, invite members by going to `⚙️` > `Members` then use the `Member list` to invite by email or set a whitelisted domain in Invitation Link > Settings and share the link.

After members join, assign roles: admin, builder, or user.

### What are the users’ different roles?

**Users**: Use the assistants and create personal assistants in the Workspace.

**Builders**: Users plus:

- Build custom assistants with Dust tools and Folders.
- Add Folders to the Workspace.

**Admins**: Builders plus:

- Add members to the Workspace.
- Change member roles.
- Manage Workspace Connections.

### **How do I install the @Dust assistant in Slack?**

To use Dust in Slack:

1. Admins must install and authorize the Dust app in Slack.
2. In Slack settings, select the channels to synchronize with Dust (excluding private channels).
3. The @Dust bot will join these channels automatically.

THEN, in the Dust app, while signed in as an admin, confirm that you want to synchronize the channels

In private channels, @dust can answer questions but won't synchronize messages.

After installation, all workspace members can interact with @dust by:

- Mentioning @dust in channels.
- Inviting @dust to private channels (data from private channels are not synchronized with Dust).
- Starting a direct message with @dust.

Advanced features to use the Dust Slackbot.

- If you want to add Dust to a group direct message, [convert them to a private channel first](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/217555437-Convert-a-group-direct-message-to-a-private-channel).
- Users can interact with any other assistants via Slack by summoning @dust and adding a tilde "~" or “+” right before the assistant's name- i.e., "@dust ~gpt4 Hello!" or "@dust +gpt4 Hello!" if you want to interact with @gpt4.
- Builders can link a custom assistant to a **public** Slack channel when creating or editing a custom assistant, the assistant will automatically be used every time Dust is called in the public channel. Go to `Build` > `ManageAssistants` > `Create an Assistant` OR _[Click on the assistant you want]_ > `…` > `Edit` > `Sharing` > `Slack Integration` to do this. You can't link an assistant to a private channel; to use an assistant inside a private channel, use the syntax `@dust ~name of the assistant` or `@dust +name of the assistant`.

To export your @dust conversation history in Slack, remember that it's like exporting direct messages. You can only do this if you're an Owner or admin of a Slack Business+ or Enterprise Grid account.

# Data

### How to add a Connection

**How to set up Connections**

Connections are available only for paid plans.

As an Admin, go to ️`Build`> `Connections` > Select the desired Connection, click `Connect` > Authenticate your account, and select the data you wish to synchronize with Dust.

Please ensure to read the guides related to the Connection you are willing to set before setting it up - here is the link with all the guides [https://docs.dust.tt?pvs=4#4f7f969e52464e369f4cd453457d8059](https://docs.dust.tt)).

Avoid having multiple admins, 2 or 3 is ideal. Ensure you edit Connection cautiously.

**How to update Connections**

As an admin, ️ ️`Build` > `Connections` > Select the desired Connection, click `Manage` > `Add/Remove data` > Explore, and either select or deselect the data you want to synchronize with Dust.

### What are Connections' current limits?

- Slack: Dust doesn't take into account private channels, group direct messages, external files, or content behind a URL.
- Notion: Dust doesn't take into account external files or content behind a URL.
- Google Drive: Dust doesn't take into account files with more than 750Kb of extracted text. Supported files include GDocs, GSlides, and .txt files but not PDFs (unless the feature was activated for your workspace. Contact us to know more). Assistants can read document titles, but not folder names, and not images in document.
- Github: Dust only gathers data from issues, discussions, and top-level pull request comments (but not in-code comments in pull requests, nor the actual source code or other GitHub data)
- Public Websites: Up to 500 web pages from a public website can be synchronized.
- Confluence: Dust does not synchronize private spaces. Dust does not access pages with view limitations and will not capture any content from a restricted page. This restriction also applies to all the child pages of such pages.
- Intercom: Dust will index only the conversations from the selected Teams that were initiated within the past 90 days and concluded (marked as closed). For the Help Center data, Dust will index every Article published within a selected Collection.

### How long does synchronizing new messages or documents created in one of my Connections takes?

Depending on the size of the data to synchronize, Dust syncs in minutes to several hours. For larger synchronization, we recommend doing it later in the day to let the syncing happen overnight. To check the last sync as an admin:

- Go to `Build` > `Connections`.
- Look for "last sync ~ x s ago."

### How to add data that are not supported as a Connection by Dust

As a user, you can add your data to a connected platform like Notion or Google Drive. Ask an admin to verify if your added data are synchronized with Dust.

Admins/builders can add a Folders by:

- Going to `Build` > `Folders`.
- Clicking `Add a new Folder`.
- Naming it and adding a description (optional).
- Clicking `create`.
- Then upload your documents.

### What are the documents and PDF current limits?

Documents up to 2MB can be uploaded manually via Folders and 10MB directly in the conversation.

### **Does Dust use user and company data to train its models?**

No, Dust does not use user or company data to retrain its models. Any data sent is retained for a limited time and this is strictly for debugging purposes.

### How many words are there in a 750KB document?

A 750KB plain text document could contain around 125,000 words, assuming an average of 5 characters per word. But remember, this is a rough estimate. The actual word count can vary based on the document's format and content.

### How to configure which data sources @dust has access to

To configure the @dust assistant, got to `Manage Assistants` > `Default` tab and click on the `Manage` button next to the @dust assistant. You'll be enable / disable @dust and select which data sources it has access to.

Think about @dust as your general assistant to explore all the data synchronized with Dust. Don’t expect 100% accurate answers but use Dust as a router to navigate your knowledge.

# Assistants

### What can I use an assistant for?

Assistants can answer questions and chat with you. Think about your assistants as an extension of yourself to create content in a specific format. Each assistant is different, so check their descriptions to see which one(s) to use. Try to chain assistants to complete complex tasks.

- Use @dust for questions about your company; it uses GPT-4 and knows public data until April 2023.
- Use @help for help with Dust features.
- Use @slack to find info in Slack.
- Use @gpt4 @gemini-pro, @mistral-medium, or @claude for tasks with the latest AI models.

You can combine assistants, like asking @dust for customer insights and then having @claude and @gpt4 help write a memo based on that info. But the most important thing to make the most of Dust is creating custom assistants: personal assistants or shared assistants with your team.

### Technically, how do assistants work?

Assistants follow these steps:

1. **Analysis**: They interpret what you're asking.
2. **Search**: They look through your company's data for information that can help answer your question.
3. **Retrieve**: They pull up the most relevant information.
4. **Response**: They use this information to craft a reply to your query.

Different assistants have varying levels of memory or "context windows." For instance, GP4-Turbo and Claude can “remember” more of the conversation than others. But even their memory isn't unlimited. In lengthy discussions, earlier parts may be forgotten.

### How to search for assistants?

Users can search for assistants inside the `Chat` homepage or from the `Build > Manage Assistants` page. Admin and builders can filter custom assistants via the search bar on top of the Assistants List in `Assistants` .

## Custom assistants

### What are custom assistants?

Custom assistants are AI agents created by users and builders in your workspace. They are made to achieve specific tasks defined by builders. They can be personal or shared with the team.

### How to create a custom assistant?

To create a custom assistant:

As a user, Navigate to `Chat` > `My Assistants` > `Create an assistant`. Then, use a template or create your assistant from scratch.

As a builder or admin:

1. To create a Personal or Shared assistant, Navigate to `Chat` > `My Assistants` > `Create an assistant`. Then, use a template or create your assistant from scratch.
2. To create a Company assistant for all workspace members (you can change your assistant’s scope later by clicking on `Sharing` in the Instructions page), Navigate to `Build` > `Manage Assistants` > `Create an assistant`.

Setup involves:

- **Instructions**: Write clear, detailed prompts for the assistant.
- **Advanced Settings**: Pick a model and set the creativity level (temperature).
  - **Deterministic (0)**: Straightforward, factual answers.
  - **Factual (0.2)**: A slight bit of unpredictability.
  - **Balanced (0.7)**: More variety in responses.
  - **Creative (1.0)**: High creativity for brainstorming.
- **Actions**:
  - `Reply only`: to use the model with no data source retrieval.
  - `Use data sources` which come with 3 different methods :
    - `Search`: To use semantic search to retrieve data.
    - `Most recent data`: Process all data between now and X. Adapt the timeframe to the model's context window. Avoid a +1-month timeframe if you know your data set is large.
    - `Query Tables`: to answer quantitative questions about a Google Spreadsheet, a CSV or a Notion Database.
  - `Run a Dust app`: If you want to chain a Dust App to your custom assistant.

### I don’t know how to start creating an assistant; what should I do?

Consider using a **template** from the template library (accessible by clicking on `Create an assistant`). You can also duplicate existing assistants.

### How to edit a custom assistant?

To edit and improve your custom assistant's performance in these quick steps:

Tap 🤖 in the chat bar to manage and edit your custom assistants.

or

1. Go to `Assistants`.
2. Choose your assistant.
3. Click `Edit`.
4. Make necessary changes and `save` them.

## Using an assistant

### How do I access an assistant?

To use an assistant:

- Type your message and mention the assistant with "@", or click the robot icon 🤖 in the message bar.
- Always start with "@" when calling an assistant, or it won't respond.
- In Slack, if enabled by your admin, use the @dust assistant similarly.
- For the Dust Slackbot, use the syntax "@dust ~gpt4" and your question to engage with @gpt4, for example.

### How do I talk to an assistant?

When engaging with assistants, we recommend using multiple assistants within a single conversation to tackle complex tasks. Start with "@" followed by the assistant's name to initiate interaction with each one. For instance, you could use one assistant to gather information and another to help organize that information into a document. This multi-assistant approach allows for a more collaborative and comprehensive assistance strategy.

### Can I share a conversation?

To share a conversation:

1. Go to the conversation.
2. Click 'Share' at the top right.
3. Your colleagues can then join and work with you and the assistants.

### Can I delete or rename a conversation?

To delete a conversation, go to the conversation and click '🗑️' at the top right of the screen. To rename a conversation, click on `🖊️` on the right of the conversation's title.

### Can I use the Dust assistants in different languages?

Dust assistants use OpenAI GPT4, Anthropic Claude, Mistral models, and Google’s Gemini. They're best at English but can also handle other languages. They know common programming languages, too.

### Can assistants create a new file or document directly into Notion, Google Drive, or other connected platforms?

To move text to Notion or Google Docs:

- Write the text in Dust.
- Copy it.
- Paste it into a new Notion page or Google Doc.

Important Note: Assistants can't create documents in connected platforms for you.

### What are things to ask @gpt4?

GPT-4 Turbo is OpenAI’s top model and is good for tasks needing advanced thinking. It's better at coding tests and math and is helpful for people without coding or computer experience.

GPT-4 Turbo can use basic real-time data like date and time, and can give output in multiple languages.

It was trained on public data until December 2023, so it doesn't know about events after that. @gpt4 uses GPT-4 Turbo.

For builder roles, GPT-4 Turbo offers 128k tokens context window or 300 pages of text.

### What are things to ask @claude?

Claude is often more accurate in tasks requiring factual knowledge and tends to generate creative content. Users find Claude's answers to be concise and clear.

Claude was trained on data up until August 2023. It won't know about events after that. @claude uses Claude3.

Context window: 200K tokens, or 150,000 words, or over 500 pages of text.

### What are things to ask @mistral-large?

Mistral’s latest and most advanced language model. Supports complex multilingual reasoning tasks, including text understanding, transformation, and code generation. Has a 32K context window.

### What are things to ask @gemini-pro?

The Gemini models are trained to support 1 million tokens context length. Gemini Pro comes with strong reasoning, math, coding, and language understanding skills.

### What data do the assistants have access to?

Dust only has access to data admins decided to synchronize with Dust.

The assistants can use:

- Notion pages chosen by the admin.
- Content from Slack channels chosen by the admin. Dust assistants can't access attachments or links in these channels unless they link to indexed documents. They can’t access “forwarded to channel” and “also sent in channel” messages either.
- Google Drive folders chosen by the admin. Dust supports GDocs, GSlides, and .txt files with less than 750KB of extracted text. Pdf can be indexed on demand, on a case by case basis. Assistants read document titles, but not folder titles. They don’t read images.
- All GitHub discussions & issues. Dust syncs with a repository's Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions, but not the repository’s code.
- Confluence data selected by the admin.
- Intercom Help Center and Conversations selected by the admin.

Dust doesn’t support pictures and comments within your Google documents or Notion pages.

### Do the assistants have access to the Internet?

No, the assistants don't search the internet. They respond using their own resources. But you can give them a text from the internet to work with. You can also create data sources with online documents.

### Does the Dust assistant give accurate and safe responses?

assistants are experimental and their responses may not always be correct. Always check the `Retrieved` bar under your question and above the answer.

Although assistants have safety controls and feedback mechanisms according to our [Product Constitution](https://blog.dust.tt/2023-05-15-product-constitution), they can sometimes provide wrong information or statements.

### Is there a Dust conversation API?

Yes there is a Dust conversation API, you can find the documentation here - https://docs.dust.tt/conversations

---

# Developer Tools

### What is the difference between a Dust app and an assistant?

The Dust Developer Platform enables the creation of Dust apps powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Claude. These apps perform specific tasks by making calls to models, APIs, or Data Sources.

Dust apps add a functional layer over a model, enabling it to operate in a particular manner suited to the task at hand.

Assistants, on the other hand, are more complex. They integrate a large language model with context understanding, planning abilities, and tool operation to respond to queries or complete tasks directed towards a defined objective, drawing on their built-in knowledge and the user's input.

### How to create a Dust app?

Dust apps are Large Language Model (LLM) apps

For Dust apps (advanced tasks using models like APIs or Data Sources):

1. Go to `Build` > `Developer Tools`.
2. Click `Create App`, name it, and set access permissions.

To create and deploy Dust apps, you must provide your own model API keys— Dust doesn’t provide API keys like we do to create and use assistants.

To learn how to develop an app, you can explore Dust's technical documentation here - https://docs.dust.tt/

You can find examples of Dust apps here: [https://docs.dust.tt/reference/examples](https://docs.dust.tt/reference/examples)

# Troubles using Dust and limitations of the assistant

### When asking a question about data within Slack, the link to the thread isn’t always the right one

When messages are not threaded, Dust points to the window of the channel message that represents the chunk whose URL is the first message. To optimize Dust synchronization and retrieval of Slack messages, we recommend formatting Slack threads as is: first message with the title and then create a thread.

### I haven’t received a login, or I am having trouble logging in

If you experience issues logging in, please send a message to your workspace Admin, or our team [team@dust.tt](mailto:team@dust.tt) will investigate.

### The assistant is producing links that don’t work and falsely claiming something untrue. What’s going on?

Assistants are limited to text responses and can't browse the internet or use unapproved tools. They rely on approved data sources and Admin permissions.

GPT4 and Claude are transformer-based models. They're trained to predict the next word in a sentence using probability, not grammar. For example, if you input 'chair', it predicts the next word based on patterns. But it doesn't really "understand" what a chair is. That's why the assistant might sometimes make mistakes or "hallucinate".

### Why doesn't the assistant remember what I said earlier in a conversation?

Assistants have a limited memory for conversation context. They may forget earlier parts of a long chat, which can result in incorrect responses. As Dust and Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve, assistants' ability to handle longer conversations will improve.

### Can Dust remember and incorporate my feedback in the future?

Assistants have a short memory and don't recall past conversations. To give assistants guidance on your writing or thinking style, include a "constitution"—a list of rules and principles—in the assistant's instructions.

### Is Dust down?
