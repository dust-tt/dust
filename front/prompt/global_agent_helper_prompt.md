# About Dust

## What is Dust?

Dust is a platform powered by GPT4, Claude, and Mistral. It's designed to help teams work better with AI. These AI assistants are there to enhance your understanding of any topic, increase productivity, and improve work processes. They can help with company questions, draft documents, or simplify complex topics.

## General concepts

### Assistant

Dust assistants are AI-powered agents that employ frontier models like GPT-4, Mistral and Claude. You can use two types of assistants inside Dust.

- Frontier models assistants: Frontier models are large-scale models that exceed the capabilities currently present in the most advanced existing models created by providers such as **OpenAI, Google DeepMind,** **Anthropic, Meta, Mistral** or **Microsoft;** Frontier models assistants like @gpt4, for example, can be used for completing general tasks like recognizing, summarizing, translating, and generating text and other forms of content.
- Custom assistants: assistants created by Dust or builders from your company workspace to answer specific use cases. Custom assistants can be augmented with retrieval or see their instructions customized. Custom assistants can be used for completing specific tasks defined by Dust or the builders. Dust created custom assistants like @notion or @slack to help you interact directly with your Notion or Slack synchronized documents. Builders at your company can also create custom assistants to help you complete many tasks like improving SQL queries, supporting the customer success team, giving feedback on UX writing content, or writing specific memos or reports.

To illustrate, while @dust handles organizational questions, @help provides Dust support, @slack searches Slack, and @gpt4/@claude offer direct large language model access. Multiple assistants can be leveraged concurrently to tackle varied tasks.

### Conversation

Interactions with assistants happen in "conversations" where users ask questions or requests, and the assistants respond using accessible data.

Sharing conversation links grants collaborative access to all workspace members, enhancing teamwork.

Create conversations for new topics to keep the assistants focused!

### Workspace

A Workspace in Dust is the main environment where users create conversations and interact with the Dust assistants. Each workspace is unique and can be personalized to cater to specific team use cases. Workspace admins have the ability to view top-level resources of a Connection and can control the visibility and accessibility of data within the workspace. They can also invite other members to the workspace and assign them roles, enhancing collaboration and knowledge sharing.

### Connections & Data Sources

In Dust, a “Connections” and "Data Sources" refers to the locations from which the Dust assistants retrieve information to provide responses. It can be either data from connected platforms— “Connections”, or documents manually uploaded— “Data Sources”.

Connections are platforms like Notion, Google Drive, GitHub or Slack that Dust synchronizes with directly. Connections are available to paid plans only. Admins can control which parts of these platforms Dust can access. Data Sources are custom data sources created by builders to provide assistants with specific information unavailable inside Connections. Data Sources are available to all plans.

### Synchronizing

Synchronizing data with Dust means Dust will extract it and that the data will be available for data retrieval by the assistants.

### Retrieve

In Dust, the “Retrieve” function enables the assistants to pull information from permitted data sources in order to respond to user queries; it allows access to relevant data so the assistants can provide precise, context-aware answers. Retrieved information can come from Connections like Notion or Slack, or from Data Sources. The assistants are limited to retrieving data from sources approved by the admin for security.

### Embedding

Large Language Models (LLMs) embedding refers to the process of transforming text data into numerical vectors that can be processed by LLMs like GPT-4 or Claude. This involves converting the text into a high-dimensional space where similar words or phrases are placed close together, allowing the model to understand the semantic similarity between different pieces of text. In Dust, LLMs embedding is utilized to enable the assistants to retrieve relevant documents to respond to user queries.

## Workspace Settings

### How to invite members to the workspace

As an Admin, go to ️Admin > `Workspace` > Members. You can invite members by email via `Member list` or define a whitelisted email domain in `Invitation Link` > `Settings` and then share the invitation Link. Once the members accept the invitation, select their users role: admin, builder or user.

### What are the users’ different roles?

**Users**: Access and utilize the assistants within the Workspace.

**Builders**: Beyond user capabilities, builders can:

- Create custom assistants using Dust platform features and available Data Sources.
- Integrate Data Sources into the Workspace.

**Admins**: Enjoy the highest level of access. Apart from builder privileges, they can:

- Invite new members to the Workspace.
- Edit member roles.
- Link and update Connections to the Workspace.

### **How do I install the @Dust assistant in Slack?**

Dust assistant in Slack is only available to paid plans and you need to connect Slack as a Connection to activate the bot. To get Dust in Slack, an admin needs to install it. Ensure the Dust app is installed and authorized in your workspace before you invite it to a channel.

To synchronize Slack channels with Dust:

- Inside `Admin` > `Connections` > `Slack`;
- Navigate to the Slack data source settings;
- Select the Slack channels you want to synchronize with Dust- Dust doesn't synchronize private channels;
- The @Dust bot will automatically join the selected channels.

Dust does not synchronize private channels. You can call @dust in private channels, it it will be able to access the message history inside the conversation to answer but the message history will be immediately forgotten. Dust does not make the private channel data available for retrieval by other assistants.

THEN, in the Dust app, while signed in as an admin:

- Confirm that you want to synchronize the channels

Once that's done, everyone in the Slack workspace can use the @dust Slackbot. It only has to be installed once.

If an admin has installed Dust, @dust Slackbot will show up as a bot user. Users can chat with @dust by:

- Mentioning @dust in a public channel.
- Mentioning @dust in private channels.
- To use @dust Use in Direct Messages or group DMs -- you can do that by [turning the group into a private channel](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/217555437-Convert-a-group-direct-message-to-a-private-channel)
- Users can interact with any other assistants via Slack by summoning @dust ~gpt4 Hello! if you want to interact with @gpt4 for example.
- Builders can link a custom assistant to a Slack channel when creating or editing a custom assistant, the assistant will automatically be used every time Dust is called in the channel. To do this, go to `Admin` > `Assistants` > `Create` or `Edit` > `Slack Integration`.

To export your @dust conversation history in Slack, keep in mind that it's like exporting direct messages. You can only do this if you're an Owner or admin of a Business+ or Enterprise Grid account on Slack.

## Data

### How to add a Connection

**How to set up Connections**

Connections are available only for paid plans.

As an Admin, go to ️Admin > Connections > Select the desired Connection and click `Connect` > Authenticate your account and select the data you wish to synchronize with Dust.

##Slack

The admin needs to select the Slack channels you want to synchronize with Dust, the @dust bot will automatically join the selected channels. However, make sure that the Dust app is already installed and authorized in your workspace.

##Notion

To synchronize Notion pages, the admin can only select top level pages. To add lower level pages, the admin can use the search bar and select the desired pages. Notion API doesn’t allow navigation.

**How to update Connections**

As an admin, ️Admin > `Connections` > Select the desired Connection and click `Manage` > `Edit permissions` > Explore and either select or deselect the data you want to synchronize with Dust.

### What are Connections' current limits?

When synchronizing your Slack, Notion, Google Drive, and Github platforms. Here are the limitations of the data synchronized with Dust.

Slack: Dust doesn't take into account external files or content behind a URL.
Notion: Dust doesn't take into account external files or content behind a URL.
Google Drive: Google Drive: Dust doesn't take into account files with more than 750Kb of extracted text. By default, Dust doesn't take into account .pdf files. Email us at team@dust.tt to include .pdf files.
Github: Dust only gathers data from issues, discussions, and top-level pull request comments (but not in-code comments in pull requests, nor the actual source code or other GitHub data)

### How long does synchronizing new messages or documents created in one of my Connections takes?

Dust synchronization is run in seconds or a few minutes depending on the Connection. You can check the last sync of a Connection in ️Admin > `Connections`> “last sync ~ x s ago,” and check if a document has been synced and what's in there by searching and clicking on the needed document from the search bar.

### How to add data that are not supported as a Connection by Dust

As a user, you can add your data to a connected platform like Notion or Google Drive. Dust will then automatically sync it through @dust, @notion, or @googledrive.

As an admin or builder go to ️Admin > `Data Sources` > select the button `Add a new Data Source` > give your data source a name and optionally a description. Then click on `create` .

### What are Data Sources' current limits?

Documents up to 2MB can be uploaded manually via Data Sources.

### **Does Dust use user and company data to train its models?**

No, Dust does not use user or company data to retrain its models. Any data sent is retained for a limited time and this is strictly for debugging purposes.

### How many words are there in a 750KB document?

A 750KB plain text document could contain around 125,000 words, assuming an average of 5 characters per word. But remember, this is a rough estimate. The actual word count can vary based on the document's format and content.

### How to configure which data sources @dust has access to

To configure the @dust assistant, got to `Admin` > `Assistants` and click on the `Manage` button next to the @dust assistant. You'll be enable / disable @dust and select which data sources it has access to.

## Dust’s plans

### **Dust Free plan**

- creation of custom workflows
- create and use the assistants on a data source with up to 32 documents of 750KB each.
- access to GPT-3.5
- 50 messages limit

### **Dust Paid plans**

If you're looking for additional features such as access to GPT4 and Claude without limit, connecting Notion, Google Drive, GitHub, and Slack, and access to the Dust Slackbot you will need to upgrade to the paid plans available.

You can upgrade your account by subscribing to our Pro plan inside `Admin` > `Subscription` > Pro Plan.

# Assistants

### What can I use an assistant for?

A Dust assistant can answer questions and chat with you. Each one is different, so check their descriptions on the assistant homepage to see which one(s) to use.

Use @dust for general company questions. It has access to your company data as well as public data up to September 2021 thanks to GPT4

Use @help for help with using Dust.

Use @slack if you think the information is in Slack.

Use @gpt4 or @claude to work directly with the latest models.

You can use several assistants at once. For example, if you're writing a memo about customers, ask @dust for an overview of what you've learned like: “Can you compile a list of our learnings from working with customers?” Then, use @claude and @gpt4 to turn @dust's answer into a memo.

### Technically, how do assistants work?

Technically assistants first try to understand your question (Analysis), then will try to find, in the data from your company they have access to, relevant information (Search). The search returns results (Retrieves). The assistant use the results to write an answer.

Importantly, the ability of the assistants to remember part of the conversation depends on the specific assistant used - Claude, for example, has a better memory or “context window”. However, even Claude's context window is limited. If the conversation involves a long sequence of questions, our assistants may not recall the very first questions asked.

## Dust assistants

Dust offers 3 types of assistants:

- Data source assistants to interact directly with your Slack, Google Drive, Github or Notion in a conversational way, or all of them together via @dust.
- Models assistants to interact with the strongest models available, currently GPT-4, Claude, and Mistral: @gpt4, @gpt3.5, @claude, @claude-instant.
- Dust assistants like the @help to guide you when using Dust.

### How to search for assistants?

Admin and builders can filter custom assistants via the search bar on top of the Custom Assistants List in `Admin` > `Assistants` .

## Custom assistants

### What are custom assistants

Custom assistants are AI agents created by builders in your workspace. They are made to achieve specific tasks defined by builders.

### How to create a custom assistant?

If you're a builder, you can create a custom assistant. Go to ️`Admin` > `Assistants` > `Create a new Assistant`. There, you can name and describe the assistant. Remember, the name can't have spaces. The description should help your teammates understand the assistant's role.

The key parts to set up when creating a custom assistant are `Instructions`, `Advanced Settings`, and `Actions`.

**Instructions:** These are prompts that guide the assistant. A good prompt has enough information and is well-structured. It includes the instruction or question for the model and can have other details like context, inputs, or examples. This helps the model give better results.

**Advanced Settings:** Here, you choose the model to execute the instructions and set its "creativity level" or temperature.

- Deterministic (Temperature = 0): The assistant gives direct answers based on facts from your data.
- Factual (Temperature = 0.2): Allows for a bit of randomness.
- Balanced (Temperature = 0.7): Introduces more randomness.
- Creative (Temperature = 1.0): The assistant helps brainstorm or boost creativity with full randomness.

**Actions:** This gives the assistant context thanks to Data Sources. The more specific the data source, the better the assistant's answers. If the assistant's task doesn't need specific knowledge, you can skip adding a data source. You can use a Dust Application to create custom assistants that perform tasks, allowing you to leverage apps for advanced use cases.

Dust apps are Large Language Model (LLM) apps. As an admin or a builder, to create Dust apps go to ️`Admin` > `Developers` > `Tools` and click `Create App`. From there, you can give the app a name and decide who can access the app. A Large Language Model app uses one or more calls to models or services like APIs or Data Sources to do a specific task. They're like a layer on top of a model that makes it work a certain way.

### How to edit a custom assistant?

To edit and improve your custom assistant's performance in these quick steps:

Tap 🤖 in the chat bar to manage and edit your custom assistants.

or

1. Go to `Admin`.
2. Select `Assistants`.
3. Choose your assistant.
4. Click `Edit`.
5. Make necessary changes and `save` them.

### Why chose GPT-4 or Claude 2?

Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School who writes about AI, concludes that GPT-4 is better at solving math problems, while Claude 2 is better at writing.

| Model          | See images | Internet connection | Personality               | When to use it                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GPT-3.5        |            | No                  | Neutral                   | Fast and capable, but other models are now stronger.                                                              |
| GPT-4          | Soon       | No                  | Helpful, a little preachy | Strongest model if you want to complete more complex task.                                                        |
| Claude 2       |            | No                  | Pleasant                  | Strongest model to work with large amounts of text. You may choose Claude 2 if you're working with a lot of text. |
| Claude Instant |            | No                  | Pleasant                  | Same as Claude 2 but will answer faster and with fewer words.                                                     |

Table with results as of summer 2023, based on Ethan Mollick analysis - oneusefulthing.org.

## Using an assistant

## Conversation

You can create conversations that involve both colleagues and several AI agents, each AI agent having a unique purpose and capability.

### How do I access an assistant?

Click on the message bar at the bottom of your screen and summon the desired assistant(s) or select them by clicking on 🤖 in the message bar.

If your Admin has enabled it, you can also use the @dust assistant in Slack. Just call them like you would in Dust to get answers.

Always use "@" before the assistant's name when you call them, like you do in Slack. If you don't, the assistant won't reply, even to your follow-up questions.

If you installed the Dust Slackbot, to interact with an assistant like @gpt4 for instance, just type "@dust ~gpt4" followed by your question or command.

### How do I talk to an assistant?

Always use "@" before the assistant's name when you call them, like you do in Slack. If you don't, the assistant won't reply, even to your follow-up questions.

Then ask questions to communicate with an assistant. The best way to ask a question to a Dust assistant is to talk to them like a coworker or friend. Your questions can be simple questions like 'how do I create a memo?' or more complex requests.

### Can I share a conversation?

To share a conversation, go to the conversation and click 'Share' at the top right of the screen. When you share a conversation with colleagues, they can collaborate with you and the assistants within the conversation.

### Can I delete or rename a conversation?

To delete a conversation, go to the conversation and click '🗑️' at the top right of the screen. To rename a conversation, click on `🖊️` on the right of the conversation's title.

### Can I use the Dust assistants in different languages?

Dust assistants use OpenAI GPT4 and Anthropic Claude. They're best at English but can also handle other languages. GPT4 and Claude know common programming languages, too.

### Can assistants create a new file or document directly into Notion, Google Drive, or other connected platforms?

You can create a text within your Dust interface and copy/paste it inside a new Notion page or Google Document. Still, an assistant won’t be able to create a document in one of your connected platforms.

### What are things to ask @gpt3.5-turbo?

GPT-3.5 is OpenAI's fastest model but is not as good as gpt4 for reasoning and will make more mistakes.

### What are things to ask @gpt4?

GPT-4 is OpenAI’s top model and is good for tasks needing advanced thinking. It's better at coding tests and math and is helpful for people without coding or computer experience.

GPT-4 can use basic real-time data like date and time, and can give output in multiple languages.

It was trained on public data until September 2021, so it doesn't know about events after that. @gpt4 uses GPT-4.

For builder roles, GPT-4 offers 8,000 context tokens. The extended model offers 32,000 tokens or 25,000 words of input.

### What are things to ask @claude?

Claude is often more accurate in tasks requiring factual knowledge and tends to generate creative content. Users find Claude's answers to be concise and clear.

Claude was trained on data until December 2022, and may recognize some early 2023 events. It won't know about events after that. @claude uses Claude 2.

For builders, Claude can handle the most context: 100k tokens, or about 175 pages of text.

### What are things to ask @claude-instant?

Claude-instant can analyze and work with long sections of books, code, documents, transcripts, and more.

For builders, Claude-instant can handle the most context: 100k tokens, or about 175 pages of text.

### What are things to ask @mistral?

Mistral-7B-instruct is a state-of-the-art 7.3 billion parameter language model. Mistral is a base model, proficient in various English language tasks.

### What data do the assistants have access to?

Dust only has access to data you decided to synchronize with Dust when creating a data source or setting up a Connection. If you connect Google Drive for example, Dust will synchronize only the documents you chose to synchronize as an admin.

Your workspace admin needs to add or confirm the inclusion of a data source. The assistants can use:

- Notion pages chosen by the admin.
- Content from Slack channels chosen by the admin. Dust assistants can't access attachments or links in these channels unless they link to indexed documents.
- Google Drive folders chosen by the admin. Dust supports GDocs, GSlides, and .txt files with less than 750KB of extracted text.
- All GitHub discussions & issues. Dust syncs with a repository's Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions, but not the repository’s code.

Dust doesn’t support pictures and comment within your Google documents or Notion pages.

### Do the assistants have access to the Internet?

No, the assistants don't search the internet. They respond using their own resources. But you can give them text from the internet to work with. You can also create data sources with online documents.

### Does the Dust assistant give accurate and safe responses?

assistants are experimental and their responses may not always be correct. Always check the `Retrieved` bar under your question and above the answer.

Although assistants have safety controls and feedback mechanisms according to our [Product Constitution](https://blog.dust.tt/2023-05-15-product-constitution), they can sometimes provide wrong information or statements.

### Is there a Dust conversation API?

Yes there is a Dust conversation API, you can find the documentation here - https://docs.dust.tt/conversations

---

# Developer Tools

### What is the difference between a Dust app and an assistant?

The Dust Developer Platform lets you create and launch Large Language Model apps, or Dust apps. The Dust Platform lets you create custom AI assistants using GPT-4 and Claude.

A Large Language Model app uses one or more calls to models or services like APIs or Data Sources to do a specific task. They're like a layer on top of a model that makes it work a certain way.

Assistants are different. They combine a large language model, context, planning skills, and tool use. They're built to give an answer or do a task based on a specific goal. They use their own knowledge and the questions they're asked to do this.

### How to create custom apps?

As an Admin or a builder, to create Dust custom apps go to ️Admin > `Developers`> `Tools` > select `Create App` . From there, you can give the app a name and decide who can access the app.

To learn how to develop an app you can explore Dust technical documentation here - https://docs.dust.tt/

## Troubles using Dust and limitations of the assistant

### I haven’t received a login, or I am having trouble logging in

If you experience issues logging in please send a message to your workspace Admin or our team [team@dust.tt](mailto:team@dust.tt) will investigate.

### The assistant is producing links that don’t work and falsely claiming something untrue. What’s going on?

Assistants can sometimes overstate their abilities. Despite what they might imply, assistants can't use the internet or any tools or software not approved by the Admin. They can only use approved data sources and provide text responses.

GPT4 and Claude are transformer-based models. They're trained to predict the next word in a sentence using probability, not grammar. For example, if you input 'chair', it predicts the next word based on patterns. But it doesn't really "understand" what a chair is. That's why the assistant might sometimes make mistakes or "hallucinate".

### Why doesn't the assistant remember what I said earlier in a conversation?

Currently, your assistants can only keep track of a limited context, which means they might not remember the beginning of a long conversation at certain points, possibly leading to inaccurate responses. However, as Dust and LLMs continue to improve, the assistants will become more proficient at managing longer conversations.

### Can Dust remember and incorporate my feedback in the future?

Currently, the assistants can only keep track of a limited context, so they can’t remember past conversations. If you want your custom assistant to remember some general rules about how you write or think. You can add a “constitution” within the instructions given to an assistant. A constitution is a set of principles and rules guiding an assistant's behavior.

### How to contact the Dust team?

You can write to the dust team at team@dust.tt; they are happy to help with your feedback or questions about Dust.
