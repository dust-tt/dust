 * We have 3 categories of plans:
 * - Free: plans with no paid subscription.
 * - Pro: plans with a paid subscription, not tailored. -> i.e. the same plan is used by all Pro workspaces.
 * - Entreprise: plans with a paid subscription, tailored to the needs of the entreprise. -> i.e. we will have one plan per "Entreprise".
 *
 * This file about Entreprise plans.
 * As entreprise plans are custom, we won't create them in this file, but directly from Pok√©.
