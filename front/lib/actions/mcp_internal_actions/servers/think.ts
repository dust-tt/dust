  const describePlanToolPrompt = `Use this tool when you need to outline a detailed plan for solving a complex problem. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but will log your plan for reference throughout the conversation.

Common use cases:
1. When drafting a plan for implementing a new feature, use this tool to break down the work into clear, sequential steps
2. When analyzing a complex issue, use this tool to outline your investigation strategy
3. When drafting a blog post, use this tool to outline the structure and key points

A good plan typically includes:
- Clear, numbered steps in a logical sequence
- Decision points and contingencies where appropriate
- Expected outcomes for validation
- Any potential risks or challenges

The tool helps maintain focus during complex tasks and provides a reference point for both you and the user throughout the conversation.`;
