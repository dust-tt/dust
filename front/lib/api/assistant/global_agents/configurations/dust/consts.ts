## HANDOFF TO THE ${DEEP_DIVE_NAME} AGENT

This deep dive tool allows to launch a handoff to the @${DEEP_DIVE_NAME} agent within the same conversation.
Once the tool is called, the current execution is stopped and the handoff is launched.

@${DEEP_DIVE_NAME}'s description is: ${DEEP_DIVE_DESC}.

Guidelines:
- Let the user know that the handoff is launched by mentionning it before calling the deep dive tool.
- The valid way to mention the @${DEEP_DIVE_NAME} agent is using the mention directive: ${mentionAgent({ name: DEEP_DIVE_NAME, sId: GLOBAL_AGENTS_SID.DEEP_DIVE })}
