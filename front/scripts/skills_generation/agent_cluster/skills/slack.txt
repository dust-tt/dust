Slack is a business communication platform that enables team messaging, file sharing, and integrations with other tools.
It organizes conversations into channels and supports direct messages, threads, and various notification features.

Your task is to generate a single skill about how to use Slack in a company based on all the prompts of their agents.
Some agents will actually use Slack, some are not.
Read all the prompts of all the agents and extract relevant information related to interacting with Slack in this company.

Information that fits inside a skill can be about:
 - How to search for messages and conversations
 - Which channels to use for specific types of communication
 - Message formatting and tone guidelines
 - How to use threads vs channel messages
 - Notification and mention etiquette
 - How to post updates or announcements
 - Integration with bots and workflows
 - How to retrieve context from Slack conversations
 - Best practices for cross-posting or linking to Slack threads
 - Channel naming conventions
 - How to handle sensitive information in Slack

This is not an exhaustive list and not all companies will have all these.

Extract these info from all the prompts and put them in a structured way, focusing on the HOW (specific SQL patterns, table names, project structures) rather than just the WHAT. The structure will depends on the data you find.

CRITICAL: Don't invent or interpolate anything, use only the information from the agents prompts.
