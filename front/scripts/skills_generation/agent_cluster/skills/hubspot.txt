HubSpot is a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) platform that helps companies manage sales, marketing, and customer service activities.
It tracks deals, contacts, companies, and interactions throughout the customer lifecycle.

Your task is to generate a single skill about how to use HubSpot in a company based on all the prompts of their agents.
Some agents will actually use HubSpot, some are not.
Read all the prompts of all the agents and extract relevant information related to interacting with HubSpot in this company.

Information that fits inside a skill can be about:
 - How to search for and retrieve deal, contact, or company information
 - Pipeline stages and how to update deal stages
 - Custom properties and fields used by the company
 - Best practices for updating CRM records after calls or meetings
 - How to log activities and notes
 - Integration with other tools (call transcripts, emails, calendar)
 - Rules for data validation and attribution
 - How to handle deal intelligence and enrichment
 - Contact and company association rules
 - Reporting and analytics queries

This is not an exhaustive list and not all companies will have all these.

Extract these info from all the prompts and put them in a structured way, focusing on the HOW (specific SQL patterns, table names, project structures) rather than just the WHAT. The structure will depends on the data you find.


### Examples

#### Non valuable sections

Here are some good examples of sections which can be included in a HubspotManagement skill.
These examples come from other companies so do not copy them as is, it should be used to give you an idea of what is useful in a skill and what to search for in the agent prompts. 

CRITICAL: These examples come from other companies so do not copy them as is: ALWAYS GENERATE SKILL CONTENT BASED ON PROMPT CONTENT.

This example gives context to the agent so it knows how deals work in this example company:
<SkillSectionExample1>
### Deal Pipeline Stages at AcmeCompany
- Prospecting → Initial contact, qualifying interest
        Exit criteria: Budget confirmed, decision maker identified
        Typical duration: 1-2 weeks
- Discovery Call → Understanding needs, presenting solution
        Exit criteria: Demo scheduled or proposal requested
        Typical duration: 1 week, auto-creates task "Prepare demo"
- Proposal Sent → Quote delivered, negotiations ongoing
        Exit criteria: Verbal commitment received or rejected
        Typical duration: 2-3 weeks, requires proposal attachment
- Closed Won / Closed Lost → Final outcomes
        Closed Won: Auto-creates onboarding ticket, notifies CS team
        Closed Lost: Requires "Lost Reason" property completion
</SkillSectionExample1>

This example give a clear process to create new deals:
<SkillSectionExample2>
## Creating a New Deal from Inbound Lead
When a qualified inbound lead requests demo or pricing:
 * Search HubSpot for existing contact by email; create new contact if not found
 * Associate contact with company record (create company if needed using domain)
 * Create deal in "Prospecting" stage with title format: "[Company Name] - [Product]"
 * Set required properties: Deal Owner (assign to lead owner), Expected Close Date (30 days out), Lead Source (Inbound)
 * Add deal to appropriate pipeline: "New Business" for new customers, "Upsell" for existing
 * Create task for deal owner: "Initial discovery call - [contact name]" due in 2 business days
 * Log note on deal with lead context: source, pages visited, forms submitted
 * If deal value >$50k, add tag requires-manager-approval and notify sales manager
</SkillSectionExample2>

Here is example of how the skill can explain how to enrich a deal with a fictive process: 
<SkillSectionExample3>
### Enriching Contact Records from Discovery Calls at AcmeCompany
After completing a discovery or demo call:
- Log call outcome as note on contact record with key discussion points
- Update contact properties: Last Meaningful Interaction (today), Buying Committee Role, Pain Points (multi-select custom field)
- Update company properties: Number of Employees (if different), Tech Stack (multi-select), Current Solution (competitor)
- If multiple contacts from same company, associate all to same deal
- Create follow-up task based on call outcome: "Send proposal" or "Schedule decision maker call"
- Set deal stage based on next steps: move to "Discovery Call" if completed, "Proposal Sent" if sending quote
- Log meeting link (Zoom, Google Meet) in note for reference
- If they mentioned specific features, add to deal property Features of Interest for product team visibility
</SkillSectionExample3>

Here is a an example of a fictive process which helps the agent creating a deal.
This is not the process in the company for which you create the skill so DO NOT COPY PASTE THIS EXAMPLE:
<SkillSectionExample4>
### Creating a Deal with Contact and Company (Using HubSpot Tools) in Acme's Hubspot account
When asked to create a new sales opportunity:
1. Use `hubspot__get_object_by_email` to check if contact exists, if not use `hubspot__create_contact`
2. Use `hubspot__search_crm_objects` to find company by domain, if not found use `hubspot__create_company`
3. Use `hubspot__get_object_properties` with objectType="deals" to see valid dealstage and pipeline values
4. Use `hubspot__create_deal` with properties: `dealname`, `dealstage`, pipeline, amount, closedate
5. Include associations in same call: associations: [{ toObjectId: contactId, toObjectType: "contacts" }, { toObjectId: companyId, toObjectType: "companies" }]
6. Generate HubSpot link with `hubspot__get_hubspot_portal_id` and `hubspot__get_hubspot_link` for user access

Important: Always check valid property values with `get_object_properties` first - don't guess internal values for dropdowns.

CRITICAL: NEVER copy these examples but try to identify similar information in agent prompts. If you don't find anything similar just don't include such sections.
