Figma is a collaborative design platform used for UI/UX design, prototyping, and design systems.
It organizes work into files, pages, frames, and components with real-time collaboration features.

Your task is to generate a single skill about how to use Figma in a company based on all the prompts of their agents.
Some agents will actually use Figma, some are not.
Read all the prompts of all the agents and extract relevant information related to interacting with Figma in this company.

Information that fits inside a skill can be about:
 - How to search for and retrieve design files or components
 - Project and file organization conventions
 - Design system and component library usage
 - How to link designs to documentation or tickets
 - Naming conventions for files, pages, and frames
 - Version history and branching practices
 - How to extract design specs or assets
 - Handoff process between design and engineering
 - Comment and feedback workflows
 - Prototype and presentation sharing
 - Integration with other tools (Jira, Notion, Slack)
 - Design token and style conventions

This is not an exhaustive list and not all companies will have all these.

Extract these info from all the prompts and put them in a structured way, focusing on the HOW (specific file URLs, project names, component libraries, handoff processes) rather than just the WHAT. The structure will depend on the data you find.

CRITICAL: If the company is not actually using Figma or if there is not valuable instructions to extract, then don't generate a skill about it and return null.

CRITICAL: Don't invent or interpolate anything, use only the information from the agents prompts.

Don't include a section if there is no valuable information to put in it.
For instance DO NOT do a section like this:
```bad-example
## Design System
*   Use the company's design system components for consistency.
```

### Examples

Here are some good examples of sections which can be included in a Figma skill.
These examples come from other companies so do not copy them as is, it should be used to give you an idea of what is useful in a skill and what to search for in the agent prompts.

<SkillSectionExample1>
### Project Structure at AcmeCompany

- **Product Design** - All production feature designs
  - Naming: `[Feature Name] - [Version]` (e.g., "Checkout Flow - v2.3")
  - Each file has pages: Exploration, Final Design, Handoff, Archive
- **Design System** - Component library and foundations
  - File: "Acme Design System" (link: figma.com/file/abc123)
  - Contains: Colors, Typography, Icons, Components, Patterns
- **Marketing** - Campaign assets and brand materials
- **Archive** - Deprecated designs, moved after 6 months of inactivity
</SkillSectionExample1>

### Design-to-Engineering Handoff

When preparing designs for development:
1. Move final designs to the "Handoff" page in the file
2. Add dev mode annotations for spacing, interactions, and states
3. Link the Figma frame URL in the JIRA ticket's "Design Link" field
4. Tag the assigned engineer in a Figma comment with handoff notes
5. Export assets to the shared Google Drive folder `/Design Assets/[Feature]/`
6. Update the feature spec in Confluence with embedded Figma preview
</SkillSectionExample2>

### Component Library Usage

When creating new designs:
- Always pull components from "Acme Design System" library (Team Library > Acme Design System)
- Button variants: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Destructive, Ghost
- Never detach components - use overrides for customization
- If a new component is needed, add to "Component Requests" page in Design System file
- Color tokens: Use semantic colors (surface/primary, text/secondary) not raw hex values
</SkillSectionExample3>

CRITICAL: Do not copy these examples but try to identify similar information in agent prompts.
