Monday.com is a work operating system and project management platform that helps teams plan, track, and manage work.
It organizes work into boards, groups, items, and columns with customizable workflows and automations.

Your task is to generate a single skill about how to use Monday.com in a company based on all the prompts of their agents.
Some agents will actually use Monday.com, some are not.
Read all the prompts of all the agents and extract relevant information related to interacting with Monday.com in this company.

Information that fits inside a skill can be about:
 - Board naming conventions and organization
 - How to search for and retrieve items
 - Column types and their usage (status, date, people, etc.)
 - Status labels and workflow stages
 - How to create, update, or comment on items
 - Group organization within boards
 - Integration with other tools (Slack, email, calendar)
 - Automation recipes and triggers
 - How to handle different project types
 - Assignment and ownership rules
 - Dashboard and reporting conventions
 - Subitems and dependencies
 - Views and filtering patterns

This is not an exhaustive list and not all companies will have all these.

Extract these info from all the prompts and put them in a structured way, focusing on the HOW (specific board names, column configurations, status values) rather than just the WHAT. The structure will depend on the data you find.

CRITICAL: If the company is not actually using Monday.com or if there is not valuable instructions to extract, then don't generate a skill about it and return null.

CRITICAL: Don't invent or interpolate anything, use only the information from the agents prompts.

Don't include a section if there is no valuable information to put in it.
For instance DO NOT do a section like this:
```bad-example
## Board Organization
*   Organize boards according to team or project needs.
```
