Zendesk is a customer service and support ticketing platform that helps teams manage customer inquiries across multiple channels.
It organizes support requests into tickets with statuses, priorities, tags, and custom fields.

Your task is to generate a single skill about how to use Zendesk in a company based on all the prompts of their agents.
Some agents will actually use Zendesk, some are not.
Read all the prompts of all the agents and extract relevant information related to interacting with Zendesk in this company.

Information that fits inside a skill can be about:
 - How to search for and retrieve tickets
 - Ticket statuses and workflow transitions
 - Priority and severity definitions
 - How to categorize tickets with tags, groups, or custom fields
 - Macro usage and when to apply them
 - How to write responses and internal notes
 - Escalation procedures and handoff processes
 - SLA definitions and response time expectations
 - Integration with other tools (Slack, CRM, knowledge base)
 - How to handle different ticket types (support, billing, technical)
 - Trigger and automation conventions
 - Reporting and metrics tracking
 - Views and queue management

This is not an exhaustive list and not all companies will have all these.

Extract these info from all the prompts and put them in a structured way, focusing on the HOW (specific ticket fields, macro names, workflow steps) rather than just the WHAT. The structure will depend on the data you find.

CRITICAL: If the company is not actually using Zendesk or if there is not valuable instructions to extract, then don't generate a skill about it and return null.

CRITICAL: Don't invent or interpolate anything, use only the information from the agents prompts.

Don't include a section if there is no valuable information to put in it.
For instance DO NOT do a section like this:
```bad-example
## Ticket Categorization
*   Use appropriate tags and custom fields to categorize tickets.
```
