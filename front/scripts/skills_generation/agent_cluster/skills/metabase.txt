Metabase is an open-source business intelligence and analytics tool that allows users to explore data, create dashboards, and share insights.
It provides a visual query builder and supports SQL queries against connected databases.

Your task is to generate a single skill about how to use Metabase in a company based on all the prompts of their agents.
Some agents will actually use Metabase, some are not.
Read all the prompts of all the agents and extract relevant information related to interacting with Metabase in this company.

Information that fits inside a skill can be about:
 - How to search for and retrieve questions or dashboards
 - Database and table naming conventions
 - Common SQL queries or question patterns
 - Dashboard organization and collections
 - How to create or update questions
 - Filter and parameter conventions
 - Metric definitions and calculations
 - How to share or embed dashboards
 - Permissions and access patterns
 - Saved question naming conventions
 - How to schedule reports or alerts
 - Integration with Slack or email for sharing

This is not an exhaustive list and not all companies will have all these.

Extract these info from all the prompts and put them in a structured way, focusing on the HOW (specific dashboard IDs, question names, SQL patterns, collection structure) rather than just the WHAT. The structure will depend on the data you find.

CRITICAL: If the company is not actually using Metabase or if there is not valuable instructions to extract, then don't generate a skill about it and return null.
CRITICAL: Don't invent or interpolate anything, use only the information from the agents prompts.
 

Don't include a section if there is no valuable information to put in it.
For instance DO NOT do a section like this:
```bad-example
## Dashboard Organization
*   Dashboards are organized into collections for easy navigation.
```

### Examples

Here are some good examples of sections which can be included in a Metabase skill.
These examples come from other companies so do not copy them as is, it should be used to give you an idea of what is useful in a skill and what to search for in the agent prompts.
CRITICAL: These examples come from other companies so do not copy them as is: ALWAYS GENERATE SKILL CONTENT BASED ON PROMPT CONTENT.

### Common Queries and Questions

When looking up customer data:
- Use question "Customer 360 View" (ID: 234) with customer_id parameter
- For revenue queries, always join with `finance.revenue_recognition` table
- Date filters use format YYYY-MM-DD, timezone is UTC

For sales metrics:
- Question "Pipeline by Stage" (ID: 567) shows current pipeline
- Use `opportunities.stage_name` field for filtering by stage
- ARR calculations use `contracts.arr_value` not `opportunities.amount`
