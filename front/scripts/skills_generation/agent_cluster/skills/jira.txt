Jira is Atlassian's project management and issue tracking platform widely used by software development teams.
It manages issues, bugs, tasks, epics, sprints, and workflows throughout the software development lifecycle.

Your task is to generate a single skill about how to use Jira in a company based on all the prompts of their agents.
Some agents will actually use Jira, some are not.
Read all the prompts of all the agents and extract relevant information related to interacting with Jira in this company.

Information that fits inside a skill can be about:
 - Project keys and naming conventions
 - Issue types used (bugs, tasks, stories, epics, subtasks)
 - How to search for issues using JQL (Jira Query Language)
 - Workflow states and transitions
 - How to create, update, or comment on issues
 - Sprint and board conventions
 - Priority and severity definitions
 - Label and component usage
 - How to link related issues
 - Assignment rules and team ownership
 - Custom fields used by the company
 - Integration with development tools (GitHub, Bitbucket, CI/CD)
 - How to handle bug reports or feature requests
 - Release and version tracking
 - Estimation and story point conventions

This is not an exhaustive list and not all companies will have all these.

Extract these info from all the prompts and put them in a structured way, focusing on the HOW (specific JQL queries, project keys, workflow states, field names) rather than just the WHAT. The structure will depend on the data you find.

Don't include a section if there is no valuable information to put in it.
For instance DO NOT do a section like this:
```bad-example
## Custom Fields
*   Familiarize yourself with custom fields used by the company.
```

### Examples

Here are some good examples of sections which can be included in a JiraTicketCreation skill.
These examples come from other companies so do not copy them as is, it should be used to give you an idea of what is useful in a skill and what to search for in the agent prompts. 
CRITICAL: These examples come from other companies so do not copy them as is: ALWAYS GENERATE SKILL CONTENT BASED ON AGENT'S PROMPT CONTENT.

This example section is useful because it defines the priority levels
<SkillSectionExample1>
### Priority Levels (Response Time SLA for Google engineers)

* P0 - Critical → Immediate response, production down or major customer impact
        Response: < 1 hour, Resolution target: < 4 hours
        Auto-assigns to on-call engineer, triggers PagerDuty alert
* P1 - High → Urgent, significant feature broken or multiple customers affected
        Response: < 4 hours, Resolution target: < 24 hours
        Must be addressed in current sprint
* P2 - Medium → Important but not urgent, workaround available
        Response: < 1 day, Resolution target: Next sprint
        Default priority for most stories and tasks
 * P3 - Low → Nice to have, minimal impact
        Response: < 1 week, Resolution target: Backlog prioritization
        Can be deferred for capacity planning

This example describe what are the projects to help the agent interact with Jira in general
<SkillSectionExample2>
## Projects Structure at AcmeCompany

    ENG - Engineering Project
        Primary project for all engineering work including features, bugs, and technical debt.
        Issue types: Story, Bug, Task, Epic, Spike
        Custom fields: Story Points, Sprint, Team, Affected Services, Root Cause Category
    SUPPORT - Customer Support Project
        Tracks customer-reported issues and support requests.
        Issue types: Support Request, Bug, Incident
        Custom fields: Customer ID, Severity Level, SLA Due Date, Support Tier, Customer Segment
    TECH-DEBT - Technical Debt Registry
        Centralized tracking of technical debt items across all services.
        Issue types: Tech Debt, Refactoring, Security Vulnerability
        Custom fields: Debt Category, Impact Score, Estimated Effort, Affected Codebase, Business Risk
<SkillSectionExample2>


This helps the agent understand what labels to use
</SkillSectionExample3>

### Issues labels 

All the created issues must be correctly labeled.

#### Required Labels for Bug Issues
 - Severity labels (pick one): severity-critical, severity-high, severity-medium, severity-low
 - Environment labels: production, staging, development, customer-facing, internal-only
 - Source labels: user-reported, monitoring-alert, security-scan, regression, discovered-in-qa

#### Feature Development Labels
 - Feature flags: feature-flag-required, feature-flag-enabled, feature-flag-removed
 - Release tracking: release-blocker, release-candidate, hotfix-candidate
 - Cross-team: backend-dependency, frontend-dependency, mobile-dependency, design-needed, legal-review (use this one carefully)
</SkillSectionExample3>


This example shows the process to handle an incident:
<SkillSectionExample4>
## Incident Detection and Response

*   When multiple JIRA tickets arrive with similar issues:
    *   Tag all related tickets with an appropriate label (e.g., `performance_outage`).
    *   Set priority to `HIGH`.
    *   Send a customer-first reply on JIRA: "Hi, thank you for reaching out! We've been investigating the issue. Updates at status.acme.com . We keep you posted. thank you for your patience"
