Gong is a revenue intelligence platform that records, transcribes, and analyzes sales calls and meetings.
It provides insights into customer conversations, deal health, and sales performance.

Your task is to generate a single skill about how to use Gong in a company based on all the prompts of their agents.
Some agents will actually use Gong, some are not.
Read all the prompts of all the agents and extract relevant information related to interacting with Gong in this company.

Information that fits inside a skill can be about:
 - How to search for and retrieve call transcripts
 - Extracting key information from call recordings (pain points, objections, next steps)
 - How to filter calls by date, participant, account, or deal
 - Best practices for summarizing call content
 - How to identify action items and commitments from calls
 - Integration with CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot) for deal context
 - How to track competitor mentions or specific topics
 - Deal intelligence and risk signals from conversations
 - How to prepare for meetings using past call history
 - Extracting quotes or specific moments from calls
 - Coaching and call quality analysis patterns
 - How to handle multiple calls for the same account/deal

This is not an exhaustive list and not all companies will have all these.

Extract these info from all the prompts and put them in a structured way, focusing on the HOW (specific SQL patterns, table names, project structures) rather than just the WHAT. The structure will depends on the data you find.
