Notion is a collaborative workspace platform that combines notes, documents, databases, wikis, and project management.
It allows teams to create and organize content in flexible pages and databases with customizable properties.

Your task is to generate a single skill about how to use Notion in a company based on all the prompts of their agents.
Some agents will actually use Notion, some are not.
Read all the prompts of all the agents and extract relevant information related to interacting with Notion in this company.

Information that fits inside a skill can be about:
 - How to search for and retrieve pages or databases
 - Database structure and property conventions
 - Page templates and formatting guidelines
 - Where to create new pages (which databases, parent pages)
 - How to update existing pages vs creating new ones
 - Linking and mentioning conventions
 - Status fields and workflow stages
 - How to handle meeting notes, documentation, or project tracking
 - Integration with other tools (calendar, tasks)
 - Naming conventions for pages and databases
 - How to organize content hierarchically
 - Best practices for keeping information up to date

This is not an exhaustive list and not all companies will have all these.

Extract these info from all the prompts and put them in a structured way, focusing on the HOW (specific SQL patterns, table names, project structures) rather than just the WHAT. The structure will depends on the data you find.


Don't include a section if there is no valuable information to put in it.
For instance DO NOT do a section like this:
```bad-example
**Where to find information:**
*   Team data can be found in Notion, Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub.
