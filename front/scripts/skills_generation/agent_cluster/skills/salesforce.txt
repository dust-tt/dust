Salesforce is a leading CRM (Customer Relationship Management) platform used for sales, marketing, service, and analytics.
It manages accounts, contacts, opportunities, leads, cases, and custom objects throughout the customer lifecycle.

Your task is to generate a single skill about how to use Salesforce in a company based on all the prompts of their agents.
Some agents will actually use Salesforce, some are not.
Read all the prompts of all the agents and extract relevant information related to interacting with Salesforce in this company.

Information that fits inside a skill can be about:
 - How to search for and retrieve accounts, contacts, opportunities, or leads
 - Opportunity stages and how to update deal progression
 - Custom objects and fields used by the company
 - SOQL query patterns and filters commonly used
 - Best practices for updating records after calls, meetings, or events
 - How to log activities, tasks, and notes
 - Account and contact ownership rules
 - Integration with other tools (Gong, Outreach, marketing automation)
 - Rules for data validation and record attribution
 - How to handle lead conversion and opportunity creation
 - Territory and assignment rules
 - Reporting and dashboard conventions
 - Record types and picklist values specific to the company

This is not an exhaustive list and not all companies will have all these.

Extract these info from all the prompts and put them in a structured way, focusing on the HOW (specific SQL patterns, table names, project structures) rather than just the WHAT. The structure will depends on the data you find.

CRITICAL: If the company is not actually using Github or if there is not valuable instructions to extract, then don't generate a skill about it and return null.


### Examples

Here are some good examples of sections which can be included in a ConfluenceEdition skill.
These examples come from other companies so do not copy them as is, it should be used to give you an idea of what is useful in a skill and what to search for in the agent prompts. 
CRITICAL: These examples come from other companies so do not copy them as is: ALWAYS GENERATE SKILL CONTENT BASED ON PROMPT CONTENT.

### Querying Salesforce Data (Using Salesforce Tools) at Acme
When asked to find or analyze Salesforce records:
* Use salesforce__describe_object first to understand available fields: salesforce__describe_object(objectName='Opportunity')
* For simple queries, use salesforce__execute_read_query with SOQL:
    * Example: SELECT Id, Name, StageName, Amount, CloseDate FROM Opportunity WHERE StageName = 'Proposal/Price Quote' AND Amount > 50000
* For custom fields, append __c: SELECT Account.Name, Custom_Field__c FROM Opportunity (remember we have Competitor and Next_step as a custom field)
* For related objects (parent-to-child), use dot notation: SELECT Account.Name, Owner.Email FROM Opportunity
* For child relationships (subqueries): SELECT Name, (SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Contacts) FROM Account
* Always include LIMIT clause for large queries: LIMIT 200 to avoid timeouts
* Use WHERE CloseDate >= 01-31-2026 for date filtering, we always american date format at Acme

**SOQL Query Patterns and Filters:**

When querying Salesforce, use SOQL to retrieve data from PersonAccount objects.
Example queries include:
    *   Retrieving tickets in progress: `Report "00OJ8000000ZZNtMAO"`
    *   Fetching NPS/OSAT data: `Report "00OTn000003qYtVMAU"`
    *   Listing reducted opportunities: `Report "00OJ8000000ZYiSMAW"`
    *   Getting APAC data: `Report "00O09000009zjpIEAQ"`
    *   Finding quotes in AZFFA in pending: `Report "00OJ8000000ZZMRMA4"`
