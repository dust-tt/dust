Confluence is Atlassian's collaborative wiki and documentation platform used for creating, organizing, and sharing knowledge.
It manages pages, spaces, templates, and documentation across teams and projects.

Your task is to generate a single skill about how to use Confluence in a company based on all the prompts of their agents.
Some agents will actually use Confluence, some are not.
Read all the prompts of all the agents and extract relevant information related to interacting with Confluence in this company.

Information that fits inside a skill can be about:
 - Space naming conventions and organization
 - How to search for pages and content
 - Page templates used for specific purposes (meeting notes, RFCs, runbooks, etc.)
 - How to create, update, or comment on pages
 - Label and tagging conventions
 - Page hierarchy and parent-child relationships
 - Integration with Jira (linking issues to documentation)
 - How to handle versioning and page history
 - Permissions and access patterns for spaces
 - Best practices for formatting and structuring content
 - Macro usage for specific use cases
 - How to handle attachments and embedded content
 - Review and approval workflows for documentation
 - Naming conventions for pages and titles

This is not an exhaustive list and not all companies will have all these.

Extract these info from all the prompts and put them in a structured way, focusing on the HOW (specific space keys, page templates, label conventions, CQL queries) rather than just the WHAT. The structure will depend on the data you find.

Don't include a section if there is no valuable information to put in it.
For instance DO NOT do a section like this:
```bad-example
## Templates
*   Use appropriate templates for different types of documentation.
```

### Examples

Here are some good examples of sections which can be included in a ConfluenceEdition skill.
These examples come from other companies so do not copy them as is, it should be used to give you an idea of what is useful in a skill and what to search for in the agent prompts. 

CRITICAL: These examples come from other companies so do not copy them as is: ALWAYS GENERATE SKILL CONTENT BASED ON PROMPT CONTENT.

This example shows the structure of the confluence spaces in the company to help the agent know what space to use

### Space Structure at AcmeCompany

    ENG - Engineering Documentation
        Contains: Architecture decisions, API docs, deployment guides, runbooks
        Template: Use "Technical Design Document" for new architecture pages
        Permissions: All engineers can edit, read-only for other departments
    PRODUCT - Product Knowledge Base
        Contains: Feature specs, roadmap, user research, release notes
        Template: Use "Feature Specification" for new features
        Permissions: Product team edits, company-wide read access
    HANDBOOK - Company Handbook
        Contains: Policies, benefits, processes, culture docs
        Template: Use "Policy Page" for new company policies
        Permissions: HR edits, company-wide read, requires approval workflow

### Creating New Technical Documentation
When asked to document a technical feature or system:

- Create page in the appropriate space (ENG for backend, PRODUCT for features)
- Use the "Technical Design Document" template from space templates
- Add labels: architecture, team name, and relevant technology tags
- Include required sections: Overview, Architecture Diagram, API Endpoints, Dependencies
- Link to related JIRA epics using the JIRA Issues macro
- Add page to relevant parent page in the space hierarchy
- Tag relevant engineers using @mentions for review before publishing

### Setting Up Meeting Notes for Recurring Meetings
When asked to create or organize recurring meeting documentation:

* Create parent page titled "[Team Name] - [Meeting Type] Notes" (e.g., "Engineering - Sprint Planning Notes")
* Under parent page, create child pages for each meeting using format "YYYY-MM-DD - [Meeting Name]"
* Use "Meeting Notes" template with sections: Attendees, Agenda, Discussion, Decisions, Action Items
* Add labels: meeting-notes, team name, meeting type (e.g., sprint-planning, retrospective, 1-on-1)
* Use Table of Contents macro on parent page to auto-list all child meeting pages
* For action items, create task list with @mentions and due dates
* Link to related JIRA tickets or Confluence pages mentioned in discussion

CRITICAL: Do not copy these examples but try to identify similar information in agent prompts.
