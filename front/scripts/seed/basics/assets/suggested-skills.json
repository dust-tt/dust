    "instructions": "# Code Review Guidelines\n\nWhen reviewing code, follow these guidelines to provide helpful and constructive feedback:\n\n## What to Look For\n\n### Code Quality\n- Readability: Is the code easy to understand?\n- Naming: Are variables, functions, and classes named clearly?\n- DRY principle: Is there unnecessary code duplication?\n- Single responsibility: Does each function/class do one thing well?\n\n### Potential Bugs\n- Edge cases: Are boundary conditions handled?\n- Null/undefined: Are null checks in place where needed?\n- Error handling: Are errors caught and handled appropriately?\n- Race conditions: Are there potential concurrency issues?\n\n### Security\n- Input validation: Is user input sanitized?\n- Authentication/Authorization: Are access controls in place?\n- Sensitive data: Is sensitive information properly protected?\n- SQL injection, XSS: Are there injection vulnerabilities?\n\n### Performance\n- Complexity: Are there O(n^2) or worse algorithms that could be optimized?\n- Memory: Are there potential memory leaks?\n- Database: Are queries efficient? N+1 problems?\n\n## How to Give Feedback\n\n1. Be specific - Point to exact lines and explain the issue\n2. Be constructive - Suggest solutions, not just problems\n3. Prioritize - Focus on important issues first\n4. Be kind - Remember there's a person behind the code\n5. Ask questions - Sometimes what looks wrong has a good reason"

    "instructions": "# Meeting Notes Summarization\n\nWhen summarizing meeting notes, follow this structure to create clear and actionable summaries:\n\n## Summary Structure\n\n### 1. Meeting Overview\n- Date and time\n- Attendees\n- Meeting purpose/agenda\n\n### 2. Key Discussion Points\n- Summarize main topics discussed\n- Keep it brief - 2-3 sentences per topic\n- Focus on what matters, not every detail\n\n### 3. Decisions Made\n- List all decisions reached\n- Include who made the decision\n- Note any conditions or caveats\n\n### 4. Action Items\nFormat each action item as:\n- **What**: Clear description of the task\n- **Who**: Person responsible\n- **When**: Due date or timeline\n- **Status**: Not started / In progress / Blocked\n\n### 5. Open Questions\n- Issues that need follow-up\n- Questions that couldn't be resolved\n- Topics for next meeting\n\n## Tips for Effective Summaries\n\n1. Use bullet points for scanability\n2. Bold important names, dates, and decisions\n3. Keep the summary under 1 page when possible\n4. Send within 24 hours while memory is fresh\n5. Ask attendees to verify accuracy"
